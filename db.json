Less naturally, the airlines always want to serve you a meal. So as we climbed into the sky, I felt there was little point trying to grab some sleep until the inevitable food trolley had done its rounds and I switched on the new version of West Side Story to watch. I hadn’t caught it in the cinema and was quite interested in catching this interpretation.</p>\n\n    <p>And then the turbulence began. It was mild at first, but we were well over an hour in before the seatbelt sign was switched off. The meal trolley appeared at the end of the aisle but it wasn’t long before we hit more turbulence. The air stewards did and impressive job of handing out meals and drinks despite the shaking and juddering of the plane. Pete went for the beef for his plane meal but I was pretty full and didn’t really fancy another round of food in a wobbly plane and just had an orange juice.</p>\n\n    <p>A couple of minutes later, the turbulence got worse and the air stewards were told to put suspend the meal service and sit down. Which is never what you want to hear. I held onto Pete, channelling all my energy into pretending I wasn’t scared and breathing deeply and Pete and the other passengers mostly just munched through their meals unconcerned. I kind of admired that.</p>\n\n    <p>There were a couple of extra big lurches that had everyone saying “woah” and “ooh” almost like at a fireworks display but a lot less fun, and it was well gone two in the morning before the meal service resumed. Eep.</p>\n\n    <p>I abandoned my film; not because it wasn’t good but because I’d seen most of my favourite songs and I wasn’t in the mood for tragedy. I thought Maria and Anita were excellent by the way, whereas Tony was a little more bland. Exceptional choreography too.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, I popped in a new audiobook and closed my eyes and tried to sleep. I suppose it’s fair to say I had some success but when we landed, I don’t think either Pete or I had had much beyond some slightly restless naps as we struggled to get comfortable.</p>\n\n    <p>We clambered off the plane and actually got through passport control very quickly, getting our visa on arrival stamped and finding our bags already on the carousel. We found a taxi rank and got directed to a free car: it was a shiny black one and the driver was wearing a suit so I was immediately concerned it was going to be crazy expensive but also it was about 4:00am local time and I was tired and we needed a car.</p>\n\n    <p>It was so fancy the doorhandles were actually flush with the car and I couldn’t work out how to open the door. The driver have to help me (and then Pete) and it was a bit like sliding into the batmobile.</p>\n\n    <p>Or possibly I was just very sleepy, but seriously, it wasn’t a normal car.</p>\n\n    <p>The journey didn’t take that long thankfully and we were soon pulling up outside our hotel. It was an unassuming door into an old building but a porter outside jumped up to collect our bags and we found that the fair was a manageable £17. Not cheap but also not unexpected for an airport transfer. I hadn’t been able to see a meter in the car, just a big screen showing fancy car information.</p>\n\n    <p>It was about 4:30am so of course we were crazy early to check in but we asked if we could have a room anyway. There was a fee for early check in (fair play, we were asking for our room in the middle of the night before) and on a whim, I asked if we could add on breakfast for our stay. At this point, I really wanted a sleep and a shower and was desperately hoping the price wouldn’t be too steep to have our room immediately.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately we were in luck, and we had a little chilled welcome drink - refreshing - handed over our passports, paid the extra and retrieved our hotel room key cards. Which had pictures of keys on which really amused me. We also got a free upgrade to a room with a balcony as it was out honeymoon. Yay! The porter loaded up our bags onto a little golf buggy and we set off to our room which was apparently in building 2.</p>\n\n    <p>OK then.</p>\n\n    <p>Saying we went in a golf buggy sounds like we were heading across a huge resort when actually, it was more like driving through an olde-worlde souk. It was dark and the shops were shut up for the night, but the sandstone buildings were pale in the dim glow of the off street light and the moon, and our driver pointed out where we should go for breakfast, where Starbucks was (that made me chuckle) and where we could see the river.</p>\n\n    <p>We hopped out and entered the building, going up to the first floor and emerged on a flat roof-terrace type area. We wove our way across a maze of rooftops with cushions laid out for reclining, marvelling at how warm it was even in the middle of the night. We found our room at the end of a passage and entered into air conditioned bliss.</p>\n\n    <p>The room was lovely: stylish with Middle Eastern touches without being cluttered and while I was keen to investigate it properly, we were also exhausted. Our phone rang - a bit of a surprise - but it was reception saying they’d accidentally over-charged us so could they void the payment and take the money in the morning. No worries. So we set an alarm for 10:45 and fell into bed.</p>\n\n    <p>We woke to my alarm - I was pretty deeply asleep as it made me jump - and we got out of bed to go and investigate breakfast. The hotel served breakfast until noon which had delighted Pete who believes that eating breakfast much before ten is a travesty.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52295377095_a5280ab74c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52294893011_0736be75cd_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>But first we had to find the restaurant. We made a bit of a meal of it, truth be told and pun intended, as the journey past the restaurant which had seemed simple and clear a couple of hours ago in the dark now seemed unnecessarily complex. The heat was INTENSE but it wasn’t nearly as humid as Vietnam had been. More like an oven than a steam room.</p>\n\n    <p>We were meandering a bit aimlessly around the soul looking for the right building and following the odd chalk board sign the hotel had laid out, dodging around corners, losing the trail and then finding it again. Eventually, we climbed an outlet door staircase and located the right spot. And we entered breakfast heaven.</p>\n\n    <p>I don’t think it’s overdoing it to say it was the best breakfast of the trip to date. Like, seriously epic.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52293908047_cae3772477_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52294892916_efcaac9f75_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The breakfast room was cool and light, and there was buffet plus a menu of hot food we could order. We both picked with saffron French toast and I ordered a SIDE OF HASH BROWNS!!!! The first ones of the trip! Finally, after 40 days, I felt like the honeymoon was properly starting. Facto.</p>\n\n    <p>We helped ourselves to the food, Pete making an array of sandwiches with a selection of tasty breads, meats and salads and I knocked together a pretty epic granola and yoghurt bowl if I say so myself.</p>\n\n    <p>The tea was admittedly disappointing mostly because the hot water was decidedly not, but everything else was lush. The French toast we beautiful, served with sweet cream, maple syrup and covered in raspberries and pistachios, the hash browns were a delight and I had a little hash brown butty while promising myself double rations the next day, and we even finished off with a selection of fruit and a donut.</p>\n\n    <p>Having a meal seemed to jerk us slightly more into being awake in the right time zone and we headed back to our room feeling somewhat human. It was quite lovely to see the old souk laid out before us, but it also had an oddly curated feel, as though we’d stepped into the shiny Disney version of Aladdin. I sort of loved it, and Pete reckoned he was absolutely one jump ahead of the lawman. It was a whole new world.</p>\n\n    <p>We swung by reception to pay our bill and then headed back to our room, keen to jump in the shower. We spent the early afternoon sorting out, chilling with a tea and I caught up with my journal, and then we gathered our things ready to head out to the Aura Skypool.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300223343_a28faa50ed_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52299234927_27a74acfd3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The Aura Skypool is possibly one of the most “Dubai” things I’ve ever seen: a 360 degree infinity pool at the top of a skyscraper and I couldn’t decide if it was awful or incredible. In the end, I thought probably both and convinced Pete to go and I was intrigued to see what it would be like. If nothing else, it promised excellent views of some of Dubai’s famous sights.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300220921_d0b77bcf75_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300220871_020b1c2822_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We got a taxi from the hotel lobby and the driver guided the car off down the main highway through Dubai. It was a fascinating journey as the city is genuinely shiny. There’s no other word for it: it glitters with money and expense, tall skyscrapers ten a penny and lots of structures designed to be flashy and noticeable. It was a sunny, clear and hot and haze made the horizon shimmer. We passed the Burj, Dubai’s tallest building (tickets already booked to ascend a couple of days hence) and before long we were driving out onto the reclaimed lands of the palm. Another place that’s surreal, otherworldly and glitzy.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300177401_a7fa10f216_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300338823_61edf56d80_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Maybe that sounds like I didn’t like Dubai. I did. But I think I enjoyed looking at it safe in the knowledge that real like isn’t like that.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300720425_96c9645a45_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300301698_9b06293bbf_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We pulled up at the lobby of a hotel and queued to take the lift up to the Skypool on the 50th floor. And it was indeed insane. We had booked a couple of loungers facing the Burj Al Arab and a waitress showed us where they were located, gave us towels and a menu. (It was too expensive to have dinner there - you know that when a portion of fries on the side costs a tenner).</p>\n\n    <p>I politely declined the offer of an extra menu to peruse the selection of wines by the bottle. I think if you’re saying no to the fries, it’s probably safe to assume the bottles are also out of your league.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300491544_dc19f7cf7b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300791000_449e180ff1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Pete and I slipped into the water of the pool which ran all the way around the upper floor and took in the views. Whenever we were in the sun, the rays seemed to laser into us without mercy and I was glad we’d booked a spot on the shady side. But the panorama was incredible!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301668559_23cb20a582_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300445837_8d24eec986_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We could see the fronds of the palm spread below us with little toy box houses and hotels lined up along the branches. We couldn’t help thinking that it’s a foolish man who builds his house upon the sand, but possibly the architect didn’t attend Sunday school. Or British primary school assemblies. If they had, they’d have known not only the proverb but the actions.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301376186_664fc52d5a_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We could see the sail of the Burj Al Arab pointing out to sea and moving around the pool, we took in the rest of the palm and the famous Atlantis hotel. We made a gradual full circuit, gazing at the clusters of sky scrapers disappearing back into the haze of the mainland and distantly, just about making an appearance, we spotted the shooting needle of the Burj Khalifa. It took us almost an hour to make our way around and we took our time to appreciate the views. Electronic music was played through the speakers, other pool users posed for pictures and sipped cocktails and it was almost exactly what I imagined Dubai to be like.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301397671_61ebcfb17b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52300565464_d766a469bd_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>After a lounge on the lounger - love a good lounge - we went to make another circuit of the pool, this time with my phone to get some snaps. As we rounded the edge of the pool, we could see the sun sinking lower in the sky, casting orange flashes into the sea and gradually reddening as it descended into the haze. It was a slow and compelling sunset but without the traditional streaking of clouds of vanishing behind the horizon. It was more of a fade out.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301397686_7ae0a99168_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We ordered a drink each and had a little read into the history of Dubai; Pete had suggested it might have grown from a fishing village and I guessed that it was perhaps a prominent port, and we were both right in part. What was most startling was how recently it seemed to have been founded.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301647224_4549d6bd18_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301912770_c01ac7410b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As we sipped our drinks - a G and T for Pete and a passionfruit amaretto sour thing for me - the light started coming on over the city and the sky darkened. The pool was illuminated from below with lights which cast a shifting green glow across the water and the little golden points lighting the world beyond glowed brighter as the rays of the dying sun departed completely.</p>\n\n    <p>It was time to leave. We popped down to the changing rooms to assume our day wear and then caught the lift down to the hotel lobby. They had a queue of taxis waiting which was handy and we were soon bowling along in the good hands of our chirpy Bangladeshi who gave us lots of advice about where to get cheap things and how we should negotiate. He was good fun!</p>\n\n    <p>Back outside our hotel, we decided to go straight for dinner; despite a sizeable breakfast I was definitely feeling hungry and according to Google there was a burger place about 10 minutes away. We set off through the souk (all a modern recreation it turns out; no wonder it looked so pristine) and after accidentally walking in a circle, we started following the river and soon made our way to the restaurant.</p>\n\n    <p>It was completely empty which is always a bit of strange one, but on the other hard, it had air con and we didn’t have to queue. So we placed an order consisting of a burger, drink and fries for Petr and Lava mac and cheese for me, plus some onion rings, and the whole bill came to less than a portion of fries each back at the sky pool.</p>\n\n    <p>And actually, while a burger joint might not be the most authentic place to dine in the world, lava mac and cheese turned out to be yummy, topped with little croutons and spring onions and although the “lava” in the name plus the lurid pink colour might imply it was going to incinerate the inside of my mouth, it was simply pleasantly spicy. The onion rings we shared were top too, and Pete enjoyed his burger so I chalked it up to a win.</p>\n\n    <p>We sauntered back through the evening to the hotel, feeling satisfied. The night air was still absolutely stifling and breeze off the river was hot and just stirred the air around a bit, but we didn’t really mind and enjoyed wandering between the jumble of sandy buildings, strolling below strings of fairy lights and weaving this way and that into little alleys and corners. Brightly coloured boats bobbed at the side of the winner bedecked with more twinkle lights and near our hotel, we even found a water station where we could refill our water bottles. As we did this, a chap tried to sell us an assortment of gemstones and when we politely declined to go to his shop, he said that Pete had broken his heart. He might need to work on his resilience a little bit. Didn’t take much.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301416671_1d7b15b732_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52301429013_dcbe3a0684_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We wandered over the roof terrace to pour room and dived into the air con - hurrah! We found it had been cleaned and a pair of brownies on a stick had been left as a little honeymoon treat which was lovely!</p>\n\n    <p>I went for a shower and came back to find Pete revelling in the air con and happily singing “Ha-cool-a Matata”. I thought it worked. So I sang back:</p>\n\n    <p>“What a wonderful phrase”</p>\n\n    <p>Pete pointed out that it should be:</p>\n\n    <p>“What a wonderful freeze” and he was right, that was much better.</p>\n\n    <p>Meanwhile, Air Mauritius who had cancelled our flight home, sent me no less than four emails entitled “Flight Cancellation” all of which suggested the time of our flight had been moved. YOU CAN’T MOVE A CANCELLED FLIGHT YOUR MORONS. I composed an extremely snotty email laying it all on thick and asking them to confirm that we would get our refund. And then I felt slight better and wondered if there was anyone else I could send unpleasant messages to as I was clearly on a role. I used words like “significantly” and “seriously” and “of the utmost”. Stirring stuff.</p>\n\n    <p>We were both feeling a bit sleepy so we snuggled into bed with some tea, and episode of Lost and the goodies the hotel had left. We enjoyed the brownies on a stick very much, there was also a chocolate covered date each and the plate had been liberally swirled with white chocolate. This had hardened on to the plate so we used the lolly sticks to chisel it off. Yum!</p>\n\n    <p>All in all, a solid evening’s work, a fab introduction to Dubai and the prospect of a full night’s sleep ahead with no alarm. Perfection!</p>\n\n</section>",

        "content": "<section>\n        \n    <h1>Day 39</h1>\n\n\n    <p><span class=\"dropcap\">We</span> arose at seven with an hour to breakfast, pack up and check out. We were soon in the lift up to the restaurant and standard buffet awaited. We tucked into egg and toast and passionfruit, downing a quick tea or two and then retreated to our room to clean teeth, pack wash bags and chargers and so on and Pete even manage to squeeze another quick tea in - top work that man.</p>\n\n    <p>And then I got a text from our tour leader for the day: we were supposed to be getting picked up at 8:00am but with less than 20 minutes to go, she had messaged asking us to meet elsewhere.</p>\n\n    <p>Nope, not the plan.</p>\n\n    <p>After a hasty WhatsApp exchange where I sent my ticket over and said we would would come but we might be late due to the change of plan, she then said they could come and pick us up after all, but that we had selected a different booking point.</p>\n\n    <p>I couldn’t see the point in arguing the toss, but our ticket literally said on it “pick up at the hotel at 8:00 -8:10” so I’m not sure how you can re-interpret that.</p>\n\n    <p>After this kerfuffle, we hauled down to the lobby, checked out and stores our bags and waited. Hoping the rest of the day would run more smoothly.</p>\n\n    <p>The bus showed up a short while later and we hopped on; after a couple more pick-ups we began the slow journey battling the traffic leaving Ho Chi Ming City. We were heading for the Cu Chi tunnels and as we left, our guide gave us a bit of a history of the tunnels and the various conflicts that had prompted their construction. This featured various doings of the French and the Americans with a solid helping of communism and a curious blend of fact, opinion and propaganda which our guide admitted to quite readily, saying that he had to give a different tour when he had Americans, and that as he had Vietnamese tourists on board, he had to make sure the information was good for them too.</p>\n\n    <p>We made a stop at a cafe and gift shop where they made art inlaid with eggshell and mother of pearl. All the artisans had some form of disability caused by exposure to napalm; they did have some nice things but we didn’t spend any pennies.</p>\n\n    <p>We arrived at the Cu Chi tunnels at around 10:45 and piled off the bus. Following in the wake of our enthusiastic guide - who kept up an inexhaustible patter the entire time - we were presented with entry tickets and a sticker to show we had entry tickets and led to the start of the tour.</p>\n\n    <p>This involved watching a 20 minute video about the Cu Chi guerrillas and their daughter against the Americans. It was all in scratchy black and white footage, but there was something about the consistency of the supposed deterioration of the film and the healthy, happy smiles of the guerrillas warriors that made me question its veracity. I could be wrong, but something just didn’t quite ring true.</p>\n\n    <p>Afterwards, our guide alternated between calling it a documentary and a propaganda film, so it was difficult to judge. Anyway, the film introduced us to the tactics employed by the Vietnamese during the war and was a handy intro to the Cu Chi tunnels site.</p>\n\n    <p>After the film, our guide showed us a map detailing the way in which the conflict had spread throughout the area, highlighting Vietnamese villages, American bases, areas of jungle and fighting and, of course, the tracery of the 250km of tunnels (that’s over 150 miles in old money) the Cu Chi guerrillas dug out to help them move invisibly from place to place, moving food and supplies and launching surprise attacks.</p>\n\n    <p>We saw a cross section of the tunnels which often had three levels: the upper layers at a depth of roughly 4 metres often housed chambers for sleeping, storage and even cooking. The latter of these tapered into long tunnels which allowed smoke from the fires to emerge from the ground at a distance far from the tunnels themselves to avoid detection. The next level of tunnels were at a depth of around six metres and the bottom level went as low as 12 metres underground. The villagers tapped into underground wells, tunnelled between villages and key, strategic points and every so often filled the tunnels with trapdoors which could close tunnels off if they were detected.</p>\n\n    <p>And that is of course before we even mention the pits of spikes installed at regular intervals to deter enemies. I kid you not.

Underneath, of course, was an entrance to the tunnels!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52294087620_b062c9c790_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52293603356_bb7fcff170_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The entry was tiny: a small rectangular hatch leading down into darkness and covered with a wooden door that could be lifted on and off. When covered with undergrowth, it was practically invisible and to be fair, if you were looking for a trap door, you’d probably be looking for something bigger.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52293605848_89e181a132_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52293605793_90e98f6b2c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>And so naturally we took it in turns slipping down into the hole and disappearing. When it was my turn, I sat on the edge and lowered my feet in; the opening really wasn’t much bigger than a human, bracing myself on the sides, I dropped down into a ledge inside. The ground was about chest height and at this point, I was able to gather leaves and twigs to cover the hatch and, gripping it from underneath, crouch down in the hole and pull the hatch over the opening. Ta-da! Disappeared!</p>\n\n    <p>I pulled myself out again, arms on either side of the hole as I hauled up and out. Pete had a go as well; as I took lots of pictures of him vanishing into the below, it looked strangely like I had photoshopped his top half badly into the picture, anything below the waist having completely vanished.</p>\n\n    <p>Various members of our tour group also had a go and I silently but smugly judged those who didn’t have the upper body strength to climb out and had to be pulled out by willing volunteers. Small minded, yes, but true.</p>\n\n    <p>We saw various other shapes and sizes of tunnel entrances, many long abandoned now as the tunnels aren’t used and are falling into disrepair. We also saw some of the air holes built for ventilation, disguised cunningly in termite mounds and the like.</p>\n\n    <p>Apparently the Americans would sometimes try and send dogs down the tunnels to snuffle out the guerrillas. Whose response was, naturally, to sprinkle around chilli powder. Hard for dogs to smell much around that.</p>\n\n    <p>Our next stop on the jungle tour was to see some of the traps the guerrillas would lay along the jungle paths. These were positively mediaeval, and involved rotating wheels of spikes, spiked traps to close around unsuspecting legs, pits of sharpened bamboo stakes and even a folding chair trap which would swallow you while, you guessed it, sticking you with spikes.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52294097795_b7884dd5db_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52294097800_4cb80c4b54_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>And the spikes were naturally all barbed so that you couldn’t pull them out. It was pretty grim stuff, and each of these traps could be sunk into the ground and strewn with undergrowth to make then completely invisible. They don’t have to be sophisticated to be terrifying.</p>\n\n    <p>We saw a model of a blacksmith’s workshop where spikes were made, often repurposed from farming equipment, and the guerrillas would also recycle shells, turning them into new bombs that could be set to detonate at the approach of enemy tanks or soldiers.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, our next stop was indeed an abandoned tank, rusty and dilapidated but we had a little clamber over it just to take a peek inside. It was unclear how anyone could have manoeuvred one through the jungle in the first place.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52292626167_ba97b3670b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52292626292_2c16237d6b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The next stop on our jolly jungle warfare tour was, believe it or not, a shooting range, where for the princely sum of 600 000 dong (about £23) you could buy 10 rounds of ammunition and shoot them from the gun if your choice.</p>\n\n    <p>To be honest, that seemed a little bit weird to us. Climbing on an abandoned tank is one thing, but shooting a bunch of guns just didn’t sit right with me. So we passed and sat in the little cafe to wait for those who were a little more trigger happy, the air tent with ear-splitting bangs which reduced a couple of young children to tears.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately, gun practice didn’t last terribly long as bullets are expensive, even for tourists, and so we were able to move on with our tour after 15 minutes or so. We next went to look at a section of tunnel that had been restored so that we could see what it was like for the soldiers who scurried along them.</p>\n\n    <p>Our guide was careful to explain that, not only had this short section of tunnel been restored and reinforced, but it had also been made bigger to accommodate tourists more easily. Because, and I quote: “American too fat because of whopping king hamburger”. Cool. No worries then.</p>\n\n    <p>We left our bags in the hands of our guide and climbed down the short flight of steps which led to the passage. We had the option to go 20m, 40m or 100m, following one of the tunnel staff. I found I could walk reasonably well if I was bent double, but our progress ended up being super slow as we were behind a chap who was trying to coax his 4 year old daughter along (the 6 year old had bailed) and meanwhile, his elderly father was coming along behind him and struggling with a bad back. Despite the signs at the start saying: don’t go in if you had a bad back. And despite the fact that this had been pointed out to him by his son.</p>\n\n    <p>The result was we ended up being so far behind the guide that we didn’t know where to go and could only go one or two shuffling steps at a time before stopping to wait for the people in front of us to move again.</p>\n\n    <p>And so we only got to do the 20 meters. Not to worry, but we definitely would have preferred to try the full whack!</p>\n\n    <p>The final part of our tour was to try some cassava, boiled and dipped in sugar and ground peanuts. Apparently this is something the guerrillas would make in the their underground kitchens and the starchy vegetable would indeed give you a decent amount of energy.</p>\n\n    <p>All that remained was to exit via the gift shop and return to the bus; we had gained a pretty fascinating insight into guerrillas ware fare in the region, especially given the challenging climate and terrain, and while the history and politics had been sketchy, I got the impression it was a tricky line to tread for the tour guide.</p>\n\n    <p>As we clambered onto the bus, the forecast rain finally arrived (good timing) and as we rumbled back towards Ho Chi Minh City, we dozed a bit and I listened to my audiobook.</p>\n\n    <p>Back in the city, we decided to be unimaginative (soft potato) and pop to the Starbucks round the corner for a cup of tea. It was much appreciated and was soothing to my throat, and we took the opportunity to grab a bite too as breakfast seemed a long time ago.</p>\n\n    <p>Back in the hotel, we had a few hours to kill before we needed to go to the airport, so we retrieved and packed our laundry and worked on a couple of blog posts. Then all that remained was to kick back until we needed to head to the airport. With around an hour to go I went to spend a bit of our remaining cash in the bizarre little shop down the street, picking up some more chocolate orange Kit Kats and, intriguingly, some that seemed to be crackers flavour.</p>\n\n    <p>I couldn’t resist. I had to know.</p>\n\n    <p>I also tootled back to Starbucks for another brew which was, again, soothing on my throat.</p>\n\n    <p>At seven, we summoned a taxi and we were soon bowling along towards Ho Chi Minh City airport. We struggled to communicate with the driver especially when he demanded a question of us near the end of the drive. I was nonplussed but suddenly spotted the diverging roads ahead, marked international and domestic and some frantic hand waving made our intention clear. It was slightly more restrained than my earlier plane-taking-off-mime when I was attempting to explain we wanted to go to airport.</p>\n\n    <p>When we arrived, the terminal was swarming with crowds but once we’d managed to wriggle our way through into the airport proper, they dropped away. Whether people were being seen off my family members or it’s just a good place to hang out, we’ll never know. We found the check in queue for our flight and with the desk due to open in 20 minutes, we dumped our bags and prepared to wait.</p>\n\n    <p>As luck would have it, a few minutes before the desk opened, a chap came up to us and asked if we’d already checked in online - we had - at which point he unravelled a comically long list and asked me to help him find our names. This completely successfully, we were then ushered to the front of a new queue and seen to immediately without following the long line snaking around the check in desks. SCORE!</p>\n\n    <p>Next came passport control and the queue for security.\n    Side note: while I was waiting to show my passport and visa, a mother and her teenage son were chatting in front of me in French. At least, it sounded like French to me. The thing was that the son had the word “pain” tattooed behind his left ear. I consulted Pete about this later: was he being a drippy emo teen and her actually meant pain, or was it in a French, in which case, why did he had a tattoo that said bread on his neck?</p>\n\n    <p>Didn’t work either way. Poor life choice. Judged.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete declined to get the word “sandwich” tattooed behind his ear.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a bit of a set to at security. When Pete’s boarding pass was scanned, an alarm went off and he was directed off to a different queue manned by some guards. I saw from a distance as Pete had a bit of a chat with them, was taken out of security and made to queue for a bit and then was taken off completely.</p>\n\n    <p>Um, what?</p>\n\n    <p>I took my time in security, unpacking and faffing with my bags as much as possible waiting to see what would happen. In the end, I was holding other people up so I gathered my trays of stuff and stood to one side. A guard beckoned to me to put my stuff through the scanning machines but I refused, explaining I as going to wait for Pete. We had a bit of a set to which went like this:</p>\n\n    <p>“You go through security now”<br />\n    “No, my husband is gone”<br />\n    “It not a problem”<br />\n    “Yes it’s a problem”<br />\n    “It’s good”<br />\n    “It’s not good. Where is my husband”<br />\n    “He’s over there”<br />\n    “Why? What’s the problem?”<br />\n    “There’s no problem”<br />\n    “Yes there’s a problem”<br />\n    “He need to check his bag”<br />\n    “We already checked our bags”<br />\n    “You go through security now”<br />\n    “No, where is my husband?”<br />\n    “He’s coming back”<br />\n    “When?”<br />\n    “Soon”<br /></p>\n\n    <p>That was the best I could get out of him. I didn’t really have much of a choice, standing barefoot holding two trays with all my belongings splayed out.</p>\n\n    <p>I went through security and quickly repaired my things and then started to hunt for airport wifi. I hadn’t got as far as deciding whether to look up an embassy or contact the U.K. when I did indeed see Pete coming back to security. They let him through without having to queue again and once his things were all scanned, he joined me. Phew.</p>\n\n    <p>It turns out the loud alarm and big flashing red light were because he’d left his headphones in his checked bag and they wanted him to put them in his cabin bad. So. Weird.</p>\n\n    <p>Also, why do they not just tell you that instead of all the cloak and dagger stuff????</p>\n\n    <p>Still, what was done was done and we wandered along the gates in search of the airport lounge. I had a Priority Pass which I got free with my credit card that in theory entitled me to lounge access. But as with all free things, it sounded better than it was and so far, the only lounges I was permitted to use were either in different terminals or were closed due to covid. Sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>However, my internet research had shown that we might, just might, be able to use the Saigonnese lounge and so we found the entrance up a flight of stairs and I presented my pass optimistically at the desk.</p>\n\n    <p>It worked! I was allowed to bring Pete in as my guest (it’s all about who you know darling) and we were soon seated in the relative peace and quiet of the lounge, overlooking the dark airport runway and taking it in turns to help ourselves to the free food and drinks. I made some toast and tucked into spaghetti bolognaise while Pete had various combinations of sandwiches and a beer. We also both had a passionfruit juice in a can, although it was a bit of surprise when we discovered there was jelly floating in there too.</p>\n\n    <p>I went back for more spaghetti but found they’d changed the sauce to a creamy sort of pesto thing. It was cold and therefore a little disappointing but Kirsty doesn’t share food, and she also doesn’t say no to free food so I ate it anyway.</p>\n\n    <p>I made up for it with a round of tea and toast. The tea was objectionable but I enjoyed a bit of toast.</p>\n\n    <p>We departed the lounge and headed towards our gate at the allotted time, glad that we had had dinner for free and grateful that we could get plenty of water for the flight. It’s the little things. We inches along with the rest of the queue and eventually achieved our seats; it was a large plane and we were in the middle block with Pete on the aisle and me next to a chap who had confidently claimed the armrest. Win some, lose some.</p>\n\n    <p>And thus, a little after midnight, we took off.</p>\n</section>",

This was a successfully strategy, and we found there were more choice too; I put away a bowl of fruit, ordered some scrambled eggs and made some toast. Yum.</p>\n\n    <p>I also filled my water bottle with what I thought was water but later turned out to be lemon squash, so that was a sugary surprise.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete also found the sausage and bacon to be much more appealing and did indeed eat most of it except a couple of bits of rind. Meaning that when the older black dog padded over to make sad eyes at us, he got fed some nice little morsels from Pete’s plate. Lucky boy. All I had to give him was some little scratches behind his ears.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289888088_473dc2858b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289881481_87dddeca56_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Back in our room, I made a round of tea and we whiled away most of the morning reading, moving out to our little balcony to watch the sun play on the sea and the bright orange, chocolate chip starfish meander quietly around the sea bed. It was so relaxing.</p>\n\n    <p>Around lunchtime, we decided to go for a swim, and Pete suggested we go off the edge of the jetty. This turned out to be an excellent suggestion; the wooden planks were warm with the heat of the day so slipping into the water was a relief. The water was little more the waist deep even that far out and could barely be described as cold at all. Patches of cool water and warm water seemed to intermingle as we bobbed and swam and it was blissful.</p>\n\n    <p>Eventually, I clambered out of the sea leaving a Pete to swim a little bit longer while I grabbed a shower. It wasn’t long before Pete arrived back though, and we ventured to the little shop to get a snack and an ice cream.</p>\n\n    <p>While the cleaners gave our room the once over, we sat on our little deck one more, chomping through a strawberry cornetto each (yum!) and once our room was done, we sat indoors to enjoy a little bit of cooler air con, a cup of tea (because it makes sense) and an episode of Lost.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288908142_315a8eae7b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288958842_052e459728_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was one of those days where I really don’t know where the time went. Somehow it was approaching five and the sun was beginning it’s descent behind the mountains. We decided to go for another sea-swim, starfishing in the water and laughing. It was cooler, but the setting sun left lovely sparkle trails to swim through. We disturbed a small shoal of jumping fish and they swam around us leaping through the water, tiny silver scales glinting before plopping back in.</p>\n\n    <p>Some of them misjudged and jumped right into us, pinging unceremoniously off our arms and shoulders. It was comical.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290201889_93511332fa_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Back indoors, we showered and then watched the dusky sky turn pink and the pier lights flicker on. The hotel dogs pottered along the jetty, the three-legged one lolloping his best and it was all so peaceful and lovely.</p>\n\n    <p>Once it was dark, we felt the need for some dinner, but as I felt super lethargic, we decided just to eat in the hotel again. The expense and faff of renting bikes to go somewhere else just seemed like something neither of us could be bothered with.</p>\n\n    <p>I put on long trousers and a long-sleeved shirt - confidently asserting I was going to avoid bites this time - and we took our seats again the bar area. We ordered the same thing again partly through lack of imagination and partly through a small menu. Apparently I’m now one of those people that goes abroad and still orders pasta everywhere. Great.</p>\n\n    <p>Also Pete said that I had all the imagination of a soft potato which I think was unfair. And mean. He’s a meanie. After all, soft potatoes can have big dreams and become potato smilies, the fluffy insides of triple cooked chips, mash, smash if you’re desperate, and probably other useful things like potato flour and vodka.</p>\n\n    <p>And that’s if we don’t even bring our the big guns and include croquettes.</p>\n\n    <p>I’m unsure about hash browns as the potato in those is grated, but I also like to think that soft potatoes could give them a go.</p>\n\n    <p>So there Pete. There are more things in a soft potato than are dreamt of in your philosophy,</p>\n\n    <p>#softpotatoesunite</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, the food came, we didn’t share chips this time (Kirsty doesn’t share food) and the dog with three legs came to site balefully at our table and made sad eyes, so I fed him most of my bacon. The little pup appeared before too long but wasn’t interested in the chips Pete offered (Hopalong II obliged though) and before long went back to his favourite, high energy activity: play fighting with the two other dogs. They tolerated this with a world weary patience, each about 4 times the size of the pup who attempted to terrorise them alternatively. It took both the larger, more chilled dogs just to absorb the puppy’s zany antics.</p>\n\n    <p>After dinner, we popped to the shop to buy some more milk and a Kit Kat each. As the receptionist started his rigmarole of taking photos of our selection and making phone calls, we just pointed to the prices on the shelves and offered him the cash. It was considerably quicker.</p>\n\n    <p>And then hurrah, back to the room where I flopped on the bed, this time pretty confident that I could now stay in for the night. Marvellous!</p>\n\n    <p>We worked on a couple of blog posts</p>\n\n    <h1>Day 38</h1>\n\n    <p>Our morning followed the pattern of the previous day: up at half eight, munch through some breakfast, resist the sad eyes of the hotel dogs who came to sit with us. The big black dog nuzzled Pete’s pockets, laying his head adoringly on his lap while I had to tell off the puppy for chewing on my skirt. To be fair, he did then look ashamed of himself.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289930871_ac2b587bd4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290372250_0fcdda5025_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Back in our room, we had a couple of rounds of tea as we packed up and sorted flight details both for this day to Ho Chi Minh and the next (on to Dubai). Before long, we were hoiking our bags up to reception to check out and waiting for our taxi to the airport.</p>\n\n    <p>This showed up in good time and we arrived at the airport by 11:15, a little in advance of our check in time. But I’d always rather be early than late and so I was perfectly content to pass the time with my audiobook.</p>\n\n    <p>We checked in relatively easily and we’re assigned exit row seats - nice, bit more leg room - and then we shuffled along through security. Once we were airside, I had a little mooch around in the vague hope that I might find a tea to soothe my sore throat, but nothing doing, which was not entirely unexpected.</p>\n\n    <p>We took our seats instead at our gate and waited for our flight to be called for boarding. It was a grey, overcast day and when we started queueing to have our boarding passes checked, we realised it was raining and we’re quite grateful for the little bus that ferried us from gate to plane.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290213809_2758d1183f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288970637_1229c1cfba_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The flight was a short one, taking less than an hour, but our descent into Ho Chi Minh soon proved that the rain was setting in as clouds wreathed the views below and it was some time before the plane was low enough to see through them.</p>\n\n    <p>As we climbed down the stairs onto the tarmac, we realised it wasn’t just raining, it was absolutely pelting down, a layer of water already draped over the runway and sheets of water sleeting down the windows of the waiting bus. It turned out the little bus was also not waterproof and as passengers were all struggled to rearrange ourselves around the internal drips.</p>\n\n    <p>Inside the terminal, we managed to gather our bags and find a taxi to our hotel. The rain had slowed to a steady drizzle but it was gloomy as we headed into the city and everything looked damp and morose.</p>\n\n    <p>Apart from those startling moments where it was all suddenly overexposed by the lightning.</p>\n\n    <p>The lull was shortlived: soon thunder was accompanying the lightning, the rain returned to unrelenting pounding and the taxi sloshed through waves of water which washed over the streets.</p>\n\n    <p>Our taxi driver managed to pass our hotel twice, encircling the block ever more widely and it took some pretty stern pointing and insisting he stop. I was miffed - it’s one thing to get ripped off by a taxi driver when they take a long route but another for him to ignore you as you shout “it’s here” while he goes for another merry round of the block.</p>\n\n    <p>That was reflected in his tip. Sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, when we had convinced him to stop, he first off almost reversed into another taxi behind us and it was only the quick wit of the hotel porter dashing out into the rain and smacking the back of the car that got him to stop. Once the second taxi had moved, the porter guided our taxi to reverse right up to the hotel steps on the pavement. He hustled us inside promising to get out bags and we were soon indoors out of the rain. Well played that porter! He managed to manoeuvre our bags and his umbrella inside all in bare feet to avoid traipsing the wet into the hotel. Wowsers.</p>\n\n    <p>We checked in and headed up to our room to take stock. We needed three things: laundry, money and milk. So we dug out our ponchos and had a quick Google for nearby facilities. Pete found a little grocers 2 doors down, we could see a bank across the street and we found a laundry slip inside the wardrobe. So we organised a few clothes that needed washing (the last wash we would need before heading home) and headed back down to the lobby.</p>\n\n    <p>The laundry was soon in the hotel’s capable hands and we donned our ponchos to embrace the rain. It had slackened somewhat for which I was grateful, but we definitely needed the waterproofs. The crossed the road and ducked into the bank: the security guard outside made us take our hoods down presumably because with our transparent plastic hoods up, we could have gotten away with a bank heist, but as we scanned the room, it was clear there was no ATM. Sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>We popped to the little shop next for supplies and it was possibly the most insane place of its kind either of us had ever visited. It was CRAMMED with stuff and food and junk and knick-knacks. It was almost as though the proprietors had forgotten that customers would need to get between the shelves; we had to shuffle sideways along them to get anywhere. It was an absolute warren of place, extending further back than anyone had a right to suppose, but they did at least have everything we wanted. We picked up milk, tea, Pringles and Oreos for Pete and some mini chocolate orange Kit Kats for me and while, after multiple laps of the shop maze, we couldn’t find water, asking at the til promptly produced 2 bottles. Goodness only knew from where.</p>\n\n    <p>We surveyed the surrounding area once we’d attained the relative spaciousness of the pavement and found a couple of ATMs on the other side of the block. The first one was nothing doing but the second supplies the ready and as we walked back to our hotel, we clocked a promising option for dinner too.</p>\n\n    <p>It was nice to dive back into our room out of the rain and we made tea and gave ourselves a little while to chill, Pete on his laptop, me with my book. It was an incredibly cosy novel which moved at a slow pace but in a good way that I felt reflected the pace of life. It was about three retired primary school teachers living in Yorkshire trying to solve a crime and that description right there was enough to make me think “this is a book for Kirsty” when I initially chose it.</p>\n\n    <p>At seven, we gathered our ponchos once more and set out for dinner. The rain had largely stopped and the little spatters that fell weren’t enough to warrant the ponchos, so we stuffed them away and walked more confidently into the evening. We headed for the restaurant we’d spotted earlier and it turned out to be an excellent shout.</p>\n\n    <p>Banana Leaf was an Indian restaurant (which also did a line in Malaysian, Singaporean and Chinese food) with an immense menu and a rather lovely marmalade cat who lay down and let me stroke her.</p>\n\n    <p>It took us a while to work our way through all the options and having done so, we were none the wiser really. We’d both zeroed in on the same dish, not because we knew what it was but because it had a promisingly curry sounding name. So in this end, we picked two chicken curries (or gravies as they were called) virtually at random, one from North India and one from the South, based on the potential of the name. Same principle as placing bets on a horse race. Then we ordered an egg fried rice to share (Pete was reluctant to go for the coriander rice) and a garlic naan each.</p>\n\n    <p>The first curry (not sure which one) arrived along with the rice and both servings were huge. The rice was piled high in its bowl and a tentative taste of the curry proved it had a very warming kick and a rich, intense flavour. Winning! Before too long, the second curry and the naans arrived, all giant portions, and we set to.</p>\n\n    <p>We’d each been given a plastic, rectangular tray (or plate?) covered with a banana leaf and I wasn’t sure if we were supposed to eat off this. No other crockery seemed forthcoming but it was also hard to tell what other diners were doing without really obviously gawping.</p>\n\n    <p>In the end, we decided not to put the food on the leaf, just in case it was a tray or mat and not a plate, and we pulled the small plates the curries had been standing on out from underneath the dishes. They were more side plate sized than anything, but it meant we could have little servings of one curry and then the next quite easily.</p>\n\n    <p>The food was incredible: the flavours had proper depth, the chicken which was on the bone basically melted off and the second curry also had bit chunks of onion and pepper which added a delicious crunch. I initially thought the first curry was my favourite - spicier and more sauce - but then switched my allegiance to the second - contained the tasty veg and flavour more complex. Although to be fair, if you can’t decided which is the best between two dishes, it speaks highly of both of them.</p>\n\n    <p>We finished off all the naan - it was super yummy - dipping into the curries with glee. But in the final count, we managed half to two thirds of the curries and rice. We absolutely would have been find with one curry to share. But hey ho.</p>\n\n    <p>We toddled back to our hotel and retreated to lie on the bed, feeling full and drinking tea. We managed to rouse ourselves just long enough to put a blog post together but then settled into bed with another cuppa, an episode of lost and our Kit Kat and Oreo snackos. Yum!</p>\n</section>",

Our taxi to Da Nang airport was already waiting thankfully and we slumped inside, eyes closed for the journey ahead.</p>\n\n    <p>This took slightly less than the predicted hour and the airport proved busy but efficient so long queues moved quickly and we were all checked in and secured with a little less than 2 hours to go before our flight.</p>\n\n    <p>Time to hunt for tea.</p>\n\n    <p>We checked any number of places but couldn’t find anything that resembled a cuppa - one place had lychee tea but it just didn’t sound the same to be honest. And fair play: why would the cafes and restaurants serve something that no one in Vietnam is drinking?</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately, I then found DIA Fast Food, a tiny cafe that had “Lipton Tea Milk” on the menu. This sounded promising and as the place was empty, I engaged the lady running the show in a long dialogue: Lipton tea, black tea, hot, Lipton, milk, a little bit (hand gesture) no sugar, hot tea, little bit of milk, black tea, no sugar.</p>\n\n    <p>I think she thought I was a moron.</p>\n\n    <p>But I almost got results. The tea was indeed hot, black and had milk. The cups were tiny but we had to forgive that. However, the tea was sweet. Sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>However, whenever we’ve tried to buy milk in Vietnam, the default is sweetened and you have to hunt to find the plain stuff, so maybe it was the milk that was sweet. Hard to say.</p>\n\n    <p>It wasn’t as aggressively sugary as some things we’ve had though and I was grateful enough for a brew that I was soon contemplating ordering a second. Sugar be damned.</p>\n\n    <p>We mooched around in search of a breakfast-style snack and found a cafe where Pete picked a sandwich and I chose a chocolate muffin. At the till, they had a box of teabags and in a flash of inspiration, I had a quick rummage and found an English breakfast. So I ordered it. Hot. No sugar. Et cetera.</p>\n\n    <p>They heated both sandwich and muffin and, which is more, added only hot water to my teabag. Lush! Which gave me the opportunity to ask for a splash of milk, keenly observing the process over the counter, standing on my tiptoes like an obnoxious, back-seat tea maker. Apparently milk was extra, but I handed over the cash willingly and was given a little cup of milk.</p>\n\n    <p>Verdict? A proper cup of tea. Winning! Plus the muffin was very tasty to so good job all round.</p>\n\n    <p>Our flight to the island of Phu Quoc was scheduled for 8:30am and we were boarded in good time. We had been assigned emergency exit seats and so had extra leg room which was nice. The flight passed pretty smoothly and I read a bit and listened to some audio book, and we landed at 10:20 in Phu Quoc.</p>\n\n    <p>We did the usual airport rigmarole: retrieved our bags, embroiled ourselves in taxis at the exit and so on, but before too long we were driving across the island towards our hotel.</p>\n\n    <p>We arrived earlier than I thought, and we had checked in by eleven. Our room wasn’t ready as technically check in wasn’t until 2:00pm so we had a bit of time to kill and we sat and read for a while.</p>\n\n    <p>Moving out to the bar area, we started to research Phu Quoc a little more thoroughly. There were plenty of things that we could go and do on the island, but transport was once again the issue. Taxis were expensive and everything seemed to be on the West side of the island. Except our hotel, firmly ensconced in the east. If we wanted to get around, it seemed that we would finally need to cave and hire a moped to drive ourselves. We decided to give it a try later on in the afternoon.</p>\n\n    <p>It was very warm (33, but feels like 39, thank you weather app) and we were glad when our room was ready and we could head indoors for a bit.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289535221_da8157251a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288908142_315a8eae7b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our room, by the way was an overwater bungalow. Booked way back when we were only on trip plan number 1 or 2 and we hadn’t even the remotest inkling we would be doing that in the Maldives, this has proved a relatively inexpensive way of getting the honeymoon overwater bungalow experience.</p>\n\n    <p>The bungalow was lovely - a little wooden hut with a palm thatch, a decking area to sit out on and even a little window in the floor to watch the sea. Amazing! And or course, the super extra honeymoon swan towel folding with leaves and petals and, in this instance, fairy light. Whaaaaaat!</p>\n\n    <p>We got settled in and then popped to the little hotel shop - it was approaching two and I was feeling pretty hungry, so we picked a snack each and bought some milk. Weirdly, the choices were “sweetened” or “less sugar”. Apparently it didn’t occur to anyone that “no sugar” is an option. I made myself a cuppa (Pete declined, soaking up some mad rays) and did a bit of sewing, looking out over the view of the sea. Wonderful!</p>\n\n    <p>We decided to have a little afternoon swim; the pool was nice and cool after a scorcher of a day, but after half an hour or so, more and more kids had descended to play and splash about and it wasn’t quite as peaceful as it had been.</p>\n\n    <p>We left the children to it and popped back to our room for a shower and change, before getting ready to go out for a bit.</p>\n\n    <p>And to learn how to ride a moped. We asked at reception if we could hire two motorbikes for the evening and it ended ip costing us less than £7. We were hoping they would turn out to be easy to ride and get around on as if so, that would simplify our travel considerably.</p>\n\n    <p>No one really bothered to ask us if we had driving licenses or anything trivial like that, but we did specify that we wanted helmets. Because safety first, folks!</p>\n\n    <p>About 10 minute later, 2 motorbikes were brought round to reception and the poor receptionist along with the chap who’d brought them had to teach us quickly how to ride them, using a combination of miming, poking random buttons and Google translate. In the end, we figured we had the gist of it (how hard could it be, really?), I googled which side of the road the Vietnamese drive on just to make 100% sure, and then we set off.</p>\n\n    <p>We started off slowly, gradually getting the feeling of the bikes and riding south along the road which followed the coast. Fortunately it was quiet and the little traffic that appeared gave us a wide berth.</p>\n\n    <p>Driving the bikes was not dissimilar to riding the e-scooters we’d rented in Myanmar, and was was a tentative 20km/h soon became a slight more confident 30-35km/h.</p>\n\n    <p>This established, we turned the bikes around and set off along the road in the northerly direction. We passed by our hotel and kept going towards our destination: Rory’s Wreck Bar. This has been recommended both by our hotel and a blog I read online as as it was only 4km away, it seemed like a good little ride that would allow us to properly test riding the bikes.</p>\n\n    <p>The going was relatively straightforward. There were areas where sand covered the the road or large puddles, but these didn’t seem to cause undue problems for the bikes and I gradually learned to just ride through them. No worries. The traffic remained quiet and it seemed that sleepy dogs were the main road users, pottering and scratching around at the verges.</p>\n\n    <p>We arrived at Rory’s bar after just the one stop for me to check the directions: it had indeed been a good test run. We parked the bikes, dropped the kick stands and stowed our helmets and then went to investigate.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289805594_4b46f6e022_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289576101_e1de2cb58f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Rory’s Wreck bar, it turns out, is actually in a wreck. You wouldn’t necessarily know straight away as it’s done up so nicely, but it’s all built within a ship with an outdoor decking and a covered space with wide, open windows. We opted to sit undercover at the long bar looking out to the ocean as the view was wonderful. A rock pool had been built between the sea and the bar, palms were dotted here and there, a little jetty reached out to sea and it was just a lovely place to relax and observe. We ordered a mango smoothie each and sat to watch the world go by.</p>\n\n    <p>It wasn’t long before Rory himself came to join us and have a natter. A genial Australian bloke, he regaled us with information about the island and stories of his experiences setting up the bar having moved over from Sydney. He was good company and it was interesting to get an ex-pat view of life in Vietnam.</p>\n\n    <p>In other news, Rory had also constructed an 18-hole crazy golf course behind the bar and I was half inclined to convince Pete to come back and play another time. Can’t resist a crazy golf.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289576071_bb0667952b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289576056_d613c1de55_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once we’d finished our drinks, we had a little stroll around the rock pool; Rory had said there were starfish in it but we couldn’t spot any. Mind you, he’d also said that in lockdown, they would pick up a starfish, flip it over and watch it right itself to pass the time. He called it starfish yoga. We wandered along the little jetty looking at the beautiful soft blues of the sky, the palest of pink tinges inking the clouds as dusk started to creep in. Lush, green mountains carpeted in forest rose behind the bar while out to sea, far away on the horizon, we could make our the edge of Cambodia and shadows of land that indicated the Vietnamese mainland.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289805634_33a0331145_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289543173_9e6ef26a09_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We returned to the bar and ordered the signature dish: fish and chips. The chips were fairly average, being more in the French fries line, but the fish was wonderful! Smallish pieces barramundi (I assume a local fish) covered in beautifully light, crisp beer batter. With a squeeze of lime and a dash of tartar sauce, they were excellent. The fish in particular was juicy and flakey, with a mild flavour which was clearly ideas like for the purpose. Safe to say, I enjoyed my dinner very much.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290128264_b6eb718d5d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289858873_bdb41c7d4f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We grabbed the bill ready to make our journey back; it was only half six or so but we weren’t sure how good the lights on the bikes would be or how easy it would be to navigate the dark roads.</p>\n\n    <p>It turned out the hard part was getting the bikes going. I couldn’t work out how to unlock my helmet and Pete couldn’t figure out how to get his started. Fortunately, a helpful chap in the car park - who I think was British from his accent - got us both on the road and we started the drive back.</p>\n\n    <p>There were perhaps 2 things that made driving in the dark more difficult than the day. The first was the dogs. They were hard to see slinking along in the shadows, but they were also completely unafraid of the bikes. They would watch us driving towards them and remaining standing quite happily in the road meaning we had to manoeuvre round them. Silly doggos.</p>\n\n    <p>The other thing was the bugs. I don’t know if the headlight attached them or we were just driving through swarms of them, but they kept getting on my arms and flying in my face. Not cool bugs, not cool.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288878372_646b9ee5cb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289850356_533909b521_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We parked up back at our hotel feeling that we’d gathered some useful transport information, had a good dinner and also managed to teach ourselves how to ride a motorbike. Excellent. Job done. Heading towards our bungalow, we could see a huge, red super moon hanging low in the sky, literally casting a red glow down over the water. Photos didn’t really cut it, and by standing on the end of the pier trying to take one, I realised I was simply feeling more of the local insects so I gave it up. It seemed very appropriate though, given that it was Ghost Festival day.</p>\n\n    <p>That’s right folks: Ghost Festival lies within the seventh lunar month (which is in fact ghost month) and the Vietnamese believe that, during this time, the gates to the dead are open and they can enjoy the offerings left for them. Often food but also the burned paper items, which went some way towards explaining the massive number of street fires in Hoi An the day before.</p>\n\n    <p>It was nice to get out of the cloud of moths and mosquitoes and relax in our room, especially after such an early start. I worked on my journal for a bit and then did a little of my embroidery to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, because why not?</p>\n\n    <p>As the evening wore on, Pete made a round of tea, I munched through a delicious Kitkat chunky - cookies and cream flavour mind, none of your basics for me - and we, of course, watched an episode of Lost.</p>\n\n    <p>And despite the inexplicable karaoke so beloved of the Vietnamese that continued wailing into the night, we both settled down to sleep early, luxuriating in the chance to make back the early morning start.</p>\n\n    <h1>Day 37</h1>\n\n    <p>I had set an alarm for 9:15 giving us a long lie in which was very much appreciated. I had nice new collection of bites as I rolled out of bed but I suppose that’s what being by the coast often bring with it.</p>\n\n    <p>We toddled over to the tail end of breakfast and scooped up some eggs and a few bits and bobs. I had some fried rice and toast, Pete opted for sausage and bacon but said they tasted weird.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290128274_0aba2bafb7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289857721_31944a2479_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As we ate, a little golden brown puppy sat at our feet and gazed hopefully upwards, even resting his front paws on Pete in anticipation of a snack. Then an older, black dog padded over and watched us for a while, eventually booping at my pocket with a wet nose. I didn’t think dogs were super fond of scrambled eggs on toast though.</p>\n\n    <p>Once we’d finished, Pete did offer the older dog his bacon, but even then, the dog munched it very half heartedly and had to be persuaded that there was food. Clearly not great bacon.</p>\n\n    <p>We popped back to our room to finish off with a breakfast cuppa. It was a warm day and while there was some cloud, the sun still peeked through to sparkle off the sea.</p>\n\n    <p>Our plan for the day was to visit one of Phu Quoc’s famed beaches and so we packed up a bag each, slung on shorts and t-shirt over our swimmers and popped over to reception. We hired a couple of motorbikes for the day so we could get about (we checked and the price of a taxi to the beach and back was almost £40 - no thanks).</p>\n\n    <p>I’m still astonished at how easy it is to rent a motorbike. The conversation goes something like this:</p>\n\n    <p>“Do you know how to ride a motorbike?”<br />\n    “No”<br />\n    “Here you go”</p>\n\n    <p>We jumped on our bikes undeterred and set out on our journey (once we’d figured out how to start them which seems to vary slightly between models). We also knew we’d needed petrol (or maybe diesel? Unclear) but we couldn’t find where to put it in or how to open the fuel tank, so we decided to just head to the petrol station and hope for the best. Either they would fill it for us as a number of them seem to do, or we could make sad faces until someone showed us what to do.</p>\n\n    <p>We rode along the quiet local roads for a few kilometres until we reached a small village where we turned off to use a petrol station Pete had found. Thankfully, the chap there took charge of our vehicles immediately, and clearly knew what to do. He took the cap off my fuel tank and dipped a finger in to show me it was full. While my fuel gauge had read about two thirds full, I wasn’t going to argue; if I didn’t have to buy any fuel for the days then no worries!</p>\n\n    <p>Pete’s tank was virtually empty though so the chap filled it and charged us 50 000 dong. A little under £2. Bargain. Which also meant that our entire transport for the day, including fuel, came to a fraction over £15.</p>\n\n    <p>We carried on towards our destination, Pete leading and navigating like a pro. The roads were mostly quiet but we stuck to the edge anyway, and you always knew when other vehicles were coming because they would beep at you. Which, once you remember that it’s not because they’re annoyed, does at least tell you that they’re coming and that they’ve seen you.</p>\n\n    <p>We pulled up at the side of the road every so often to check the route: we skirted one large roundabout where the road turned into a dual carriageway of sorts and if anything, this was easier as we could stick to the side of the road and leave ample room for the odd car or bus or truck to pass. Other bikes would just weave in and out with no bother whatsoever.</p>\n\n    <p>We zipped along between 40 and 50km/h although there was no indication what the speed limit was and Pete’s speedometer didn’t work so he had no clue how fast he was going anyway. We just figured if he left me way behind, he needed to slow down and I kept an eye on the speed.</p>\n\n    <p>We pulled up just before a junction to check where we were and it turned out we were exactly at the junction we needed. So we turned left across the lanes and dived down a much smaller side road which soon petered into a track and then turned into a selection of car parks. We could see the beach beyond.</p>\n\n    <p>The car parks were choc full of coaches - there were scores of them - but we beetled around until we spotted a bunch of motorbikes parked under a tree and left ours with them took. A car parking attendant made me move mine to a different spot (but not Pete’s?) but then he didn’t charge us anything to park so we snapped pictures of our numberplates (I would legit have no clue which was mine otherwise) and wandered off in the direction of the beach.</p>\n\n    <p>Sao beach proved to be busy: the scores of coaches were clearly dropping off their tour groups to have a set meal in the versions beach-side restaurants, you could pay to go on a boat, a jet ski, a banana boat and even that parachute thing where a boat pulls you along and the parachute drags you up into the air. Parasailing? Can’t remember what it’s called.</p>\n\n    <p>We walked along the little beach to find somewhere a little quieter and found one bar-restaurant type place with shaded loungers out the front. We paid to hire a couple of these and sat to watch the world go by for a bit. The beach was pleasantly sandy and the sea was shallow and blue, perfect for paddling. Pete set out to have a swim and found he had to go quite far out before it was deep enough. Scores of boats were moored up, some empty, some bringing in more day trippers and some pootling around with noisy engines with no evident purpose.</p>\n\n    <p>The Vietnamese conflict between having fun at the beach and avoiding any and all exposure to the sun that might darken their skin is an absolute sight to be behold. Perched on my sun lounger, I watched multiple women wearing long trousers, hoodies (with the hood up), shades and face masks wade into the water while holding umbrellas over themselves. Insane.</p>\n\n    <p>I lay back to write journal and read for a while, enjoying not doing anything. I felt a little sleepy and I had woken with a sore throat so it was lovely to chill for a while. I snoozed for a bit too.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a bit of a swim mid-afternoon. The water was only just waist high but it was far from cold and it was a nice to scull around and watch the tiny fish flicker in and out of visibility.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290147419_ea3655c787_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290367445_beeed91fa6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We treated ourselves to an ice cream after that, enjoying one of the not-a-cornetto ice creams that we’d sampled in Hue. They were yummy and cold and mine revived me enough that I went back to reading instead of dozing. Party on, dudes.</p>\n\n    <p>A chicken strolled past.</p>\n\n    <p>And then my ice cream energy ran out and I dozed a bit more.</p>\n\n    <p>Around half four, we decided to head back before it started to get dark. If anything, the beach was even busier as we dusted ourselves down from all the sand and pulled on our clothes. Even as we stumbled away from the sea, we found more people arriving to make the most of the slightly cooler part of the day without as much direct sun.</p>\n\n    <p>Our motorbikes had been well and truly parked in but the attendant from the morning manhandled various bikes around until we could wiggle our free. And he still didn’t charge us anything.</p>\n\n    <p>We did the journey in one go without stopping as the route was quite straightforward with a couple of junctions and a roundabout to navigate. There was more traffic as folk were done with their day’s work but it was manageable and we scooted along reasonably happily.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289883633_08e9ef9c09_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Back at the hotel, we had a shower each (which somewhat overwhelmed the limited capacity of the drain and flooded the bathroom) and then flopped onto the bed as dusk turned the sky from golden yellow to pinky blue.</p>\n\n    <p>Once it was dark, we stepped out to have dinner. We decided to stay in the hotel for the evening, mostly (on my part) because I struggled to summon the energy to go further afield. So we found a table in the bar area and perused the menu. There wasn’t a massive choice but we ordered - a club sandwich for Pete and a Carbonara for me. We also asked if they did chips on the off chance and it turned out they did. They just weren’t on the menu. A portion each then!</p>\n\n    <p>After a bit of to-ing and fro-ing (Pete’s sandwich already came with chips, so did we still want a portion each? No. There wasn’t any passionfruit juice and they were no longer doing smoothies so what would I like to drink instead) we got it all sorted and then Pete went to fetch our big spray. We both had a few extra nibbles and it never hurts to try and keep them at bay, even if the stuff is dreadfully sticky. It literally stripped the pain off Pete’s side of the table when he leant his newly-sprayed arms on it. Yikes.</p>\n\n    <p>The chips arrived first and Pete somehow decided we should share them. It’s not clear to me even now how that worked out. Then came my pasta which was tasty, and finally, a while later, Pete’s sandwich and chips.</p>\n\n    <p>As we ate, another couple were having a fancy, fairy-lit dinner on the beach and had set up a tripod with their phone to capture every minute of the meal. It was...weird. They didn’t seem to get much eating done as they had to keep going to check their photos. It was sort of mesmerising to watch.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289876746_8bd56386c4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290147514_38be13b154_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once we’d finished eating, we put the bill on our room tab and sauntered back to our bungalow. I showered to rid myself of bug spray and flopped on the bed in the vague hope that I wouldn’t need to get up again that day.</p>\n\n    <p>So, OK, I did have to go out again, but only to the little shop in reception to get some snackos and some milk so that tea would happen. Some things are important. We watched a couple of episodes of Modern Family and I chomped through my KitKat chunky (it was the last one in the shop and had involved the shopkeeper taking a photo of it, searching the shelves and then making some phone calls to find out what to charge us). After that, I was so sleepy that I just snuggled down under the covers to drift off, leaving Pete to enjoy some live-streamed gaming. Here’s to a good night’s sleep.</p>\n</section>",

Once we was ready, we wandered down for breakfast, the same as the day before, and discussed our options for sorting out the gaping hole in our travel plans.</p>\n\n    <p>Our consensus was we’d need to book the expensive flight home. We could get marginally cheaper ones a day or two later, but with the added cost of extra accommodation, it didn’t seem worth it. Equally, those flights were with Air Mauritius who’d cancelled our original flight and the last thing we needed was another plan home to be withdrawn for no reason at the last minute.</p>\n\n    <p>Reading into policies and regulations, it seems if they cancel with more than 2 weeks notice, airlines don’t have to compensate you for changes in travel plans, and they aren’t obliged to offer alternatives. So I requested a refund which apparently somehow takes 2 months to process and we supposed we’d have to just swallow the extra thousand pounds that new flights would cost.</p>\n\n    <p>I had contacted our accommodation in Mauritius to see if they would allow us to cancel. We had passed the point of free cancellation unfortunately but if they waived the fee, we could potentially cut out Mauritius altogether and fly home from Dubai a week early. It would be cheaper. But it would also truncate our honeymoon, the trip we had so carefully planned and waited for and replanned so many different times just so we could get something to work.</p>\n\n    <p>I didn’t hear back from the hotel and we didn’t want to wait much longer to book new flights. As Pete pointed out, anyone else who was on the flight we were on would also be trying to arrange alternatives. Which would drive up the price. I hadn’t even thought of that. Nightmare. I suddenly wished we’d just booked the previous night.</p>\n\n    <p>And so we sloped back to our room and made the booking. Absolutely top morning.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289777115_3d8419271e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289777080_7f0f88b0a0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We set out to go and visit some more of the sights of Hoi An, this time with more of a plan to see specific places rather than just wandering round. It started raining as we began the walk along the river into town (because of course it did) but it wasn’t heavy enough to warrant the ponchos. It actually drizzled on and off all morning but we just decided to ride it out.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289777110_90b328316e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289638479_134c04dc0f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Technically to visit the ancient city of Hoi An, you are supposed to buy a ticket but this isn’t really enforced. However, there are numerous temples, tickets and points of interest you can visit, and you do need the ticket to get in. So we found a little booth in the corner of a square and bought our admission. Each ticket allows you to access 5 sights of your choice from a long list, and so we set forth to begin our visits.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289487311_c2e2286e51_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289450001_175370b8b5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As we walked through the street, we kept stumbling into fires (not literally) as almost every shop we passed had a bucket outside and was merrily burning the paper offerings we’d seen in Hanoi. Whether it was a special occasion or they do this all the time, we weren’t sure, but little bits of burned paper flurried in the air, and the wafts of heat and smoke were surprisingly regular.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289558834_264e2d7623_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289867400_bb44632d83_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our first port of call was a temple we had walked past the previous day. An ornate pink gate led to a courtyard beyond which held a beautiful carp statue in a fountain. We surprised to find three ENORMOUS fish swimming in the small, murky green pond. Seriously, they were like the sharks we’d seen in the Maldives.</p>\n\n    <p>The pink gates were seriously impressive though with three, intricately carved arches and lots of Chinese characters. The courtyard held an incense burner, bonsai trees, the aforementioned carp situation and a small shop selling memory cards and batteries. Just what every temple needs.</p>\n\n    <p>We seemed to have arrived at an opportune time however as there was a ceremony going on in the courtyard with four figures in ceremonial robes playing instruments and singing a curious quavering song. One kept the beat with a wooden block and the main singer had a mic which was amplified throughout the whole temple. While we were there, the moved to different shrines within the temple and it seems that some sort of dedication or celebration was going on.</p>\n\n    <p>We stepped into the temple to find a small cafe in one side, a large table laid with offerings in the middle and various different alters and shrives in different rooms. The ceiling was clustered with spiralling wooden cages which we later released were immense incense sticks wound into coils and set alight. Ash drifted down from above at regular intervals.</p>\n\n    <p>Part of the ceremony seemed to involve scattering brightly coloured sweets over the ground and they crunched as we walked, and enormous pillar candles carved into little montages burned at every shrine. And still the music and the singing continued.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289856715_8ae3be07b8_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We found more statues, including a twining dragon decorated in a mosaic of porcelain and a carved wooden ship, brightly painted and laid with offerings of water and milk. Incense burned from numerous urns and Chinese characters decorated columns and archways. It was incredibly interesting to explore.</p>\n\n    <p>Sadly the next stop we were hoping to visit was closed - or at least the padlock on the gates provided a facsimile thereof. Our third stop, while marked on the map simply wasn’t there. We weren’t sure if the map was wrong or we were, or whether it was not actually possibly to visit, but the assembly rooms were clearly not in our future.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289419971_cc4a5a0008_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289911155_6c4682bb35_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Instead, we ventured into one of the old Hanoi Houses: Quan Thang. Constructed and panelled in dark wood, it was interesting to have an insight into what the houses of old established traders would have looked like. There was a tiny internal courtyard with a little pool and the walls were covered in carved screens. Two shrines occupied two little nooks and while there was little to see in terms of furniture or set up, we could appreciate that it’s actually someone’s home rather than a museum.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288447592_bc1a7d1fa7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289648844_cf31444026_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Next we visited another temple, one that we had wandered past the previous day and hoped to visit. Mainly because, through the open gates and framed in an archway, we could see a colourful, twining dragon statue and we wanted to investigate more!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289911130_e6a7b3d8b9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288447607_c5b2a9bf93_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We enjoyed looking at the dark wood of the pillars with Chinese characters picked out in gold, and the dragon did indeed dominate the courtyard. It was beautifully posed with its coiling round and round, rising out of a fountain where real water met the stylised curls of rainbow coloured waves. The dragon was decorated in the ceramic pieces that seem to be a popular design feature here we sat on one of the benches to admire it until it started to rain more heavily.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289968495_db35c14de2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289483748_002830af62_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We explored the main temple shrine and a couple of side rooms which contained beautiful paintings. Pete beckoned me out to the back towards a small garden area and said there was an entire pit of dragons and a crazy goat lord to see. This seemed a bit far fetched but actually his description was right on the money: numerous dragon head statutes reared from a fountain, jaws wide and scales gleaming. At the back of the garden, a huge white statue of a goat dominated everything. For reason or reasons unknown. We aren’t quite sure how the goat got involved.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289487306_3aaa62b060_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289494458_e3bd3708e0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We’d either seen - or tried to see - all the sights on our list now and so decided to head back towards our hotel, stopping enroute for a smoothie. On the way, we happened To past the Ming Huong Communal house and so stepped in to spend another of our tickets. While it was a little smaller than some of the other temples we had visited, it had an interesting history, being built in 1820 to honour the Ming Huong village community: a group of Chinese immigrants who had been ousted from China when the Qing dynasty took over from the Ming dynasty. Those who left China were welcome in Vietnam and given the right to trade and set up their own community, and while the communal house has been restored several times and is still in need of some work, it was nice to visit and see the ornate shrines and the detailed carvings.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289720884_51f5d32585_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We continued on our way back towards our hotel and eventually reached a cafe called Nourish that was recommended online. We fetched up just as it started to rain harder and ducked under the cover of the awning to grab a table and order a smoothie each.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289494423_ff488b7ae6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289384053_bc7c534cdb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We split a portion of sweet potato fries which were yummy. Sweet potato here is a different vegetable to the one we get in the U.K. and it was almost more like cassava. But the fries were lovely, freshly cookies and served with an excellent garlic dip. I also though my smoothie was possibly the best one I’d had yet, being a lovely thick blend of banana, oat milk, peanut butter, dates and, apparently, Himalayan salt. It was topped with little shavings of toasted coconut and peanuts and it was divine. Pete was pretty good too: a blend involving mango, pineapple and banana and we were both more than content with our order.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289978490_116003ca0f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289978475_82194ff32a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We wandered the last few minutes back to our hotel; the sky was overcast and it was extremely humid but the rain had stopped (ish) so we decided to go for a swim. We had the pool to ourselves and it felt nice and refreshing after our walk in the balmy air.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289373288_32fc20243b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289449966_aae25bc4f9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We had a couple of hours relaxing in our room, journaling, having tea and reading and then did a bit of research into our next destination: the Vietnamese island of Phu Quoc.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288404857_6238dffeb4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52293794134_d18b6ed286_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Somehow as we were looking into modes of travel and places to snorkel, dusk had fallen so we gathered our things and began the walk into Hoi An for the evening. While we loved the old town, I think we were both glad that this would be our last time tramping the half hour or so into the centre. We dodged around more lit braziers which lined the street and headed towards our destination: the Banh Mi Queen. We had loved the banh mi we had on the food tour and having established it was the best, we decided to go back for our last night.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289499411_72d8edf34a_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Except when we got there, it was closed. Sigh. Definitely not our day. I had checked the opening times before we left so either Google lied to me or they were closed for some other reason. Either way, sad times.</p>\n\n    <p>We pondered our next move: we didn’t have another place in mind to eat, and lots of the central old town restaurants were very touristy and not especially authentic. In the end, we decided to go to the night market and do a bit of shopping, and if we hadn’t spotted a place we fancied by then, we would go back to Banh Mi Phuong from the previous evening. While not the best, they still made a very tasty sandwich, and we knew it was quick and inexpensive - and they stayed open later!</p>\n\n    <p>Heading to the night market, we had to pass over the lantern bridge. Something of a bottleneck, it was absolutely teeming with tourists, the busiest we’d yet seen it. However, we made it through to the night market and spent an entertaining half hour or so choosing some souvenirs. We bought ourselves a magnet for our collection in the hope that one day we will have a fridge we can stick magnets to. We even bartered down the cost because we are skilled and suave negotiators. And then we bought a celebratory ice cream as we were hungry and our dinner hadn’t materialised. We opted for a mango version of the frozen rolled ice cream, and it was fun to watch the guy chilling, chopping and preparing the mixture as it slowly solidified. Then they added chocolate sauce, sprinkles and a penny sweet in the shape of a crocodile. Because reasons.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289989965_0e9cb4aeb9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289507228_dd5b9105e4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We shared by the way, because I’m mature about stuff like that now.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289770484_dd13fcdb3c_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Feeling sufficiently refuelled, we went to the one of the lantern stalls and selected a couple to bring home as a souvenir. Our ice-cream fuelled bargaining was once more successful and we ended up with a pair of the pretty shades to bring home. And to fit in our luggage, but one conundrum at a time.</p>\n\n    <p>Then we walked back through the night towards the banh mi shop.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289790919_b602b296b1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52290014445_c91a6354a7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>When we arrived, we were surprised to find people queueing down the street, but Pete, ever the savvy diner, slipped inside and found it you were happy to sit indoors and eat, you could order straight away.</p>\n\n    <p>Problem solved.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete ordered a couple of banh mi - one beef and one “mixed” - and I went for my signature chicken and cheese. They were yummy and even with drinks our whole dinner cost us less than a fiver. Winning.</p>\n\n    <p>All that remained was to make the trek back to our hotel. We dodged the occasional rat, investigated some weird chirping that we kept hearing. It turned out to be frogs - who, by the way, did not like to have torch light shone on them - who constantly croaked in a way that sounded a bit like a duck and a bit like an angry cat. They responded to the barks of nearby dogs and it was the strangest noise. It was good to finally solve the mystery.</p>\n\n    <p>We passed a couple of bars and wondered if it was once more crate night in Vietnam, and eventually reached our hotel.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52289867420_628e048e81_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288551247_d2c9f967f8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>In our room, we had a shower to cool down and then Pete popped a bottle of Prosecco we’d been carrying around since Sapa. What with evenings out or the occasional lack of a fridge, there hadn’t been chance to drink it, and we figured we wouldn’t be able to take it on a plane the next day.</p>\n\n    <p>So teacups of Prosecco it was!</p>\n\n    <p>And then a little teacup top-up because it was our honeymoon after all.</p>\n\n    <p>We finished the evening in traditional style: tea and Lost in bed. Can’t beat a classic</p>\n    \n</section>",

And have him a card because he LOVES cards and they are his favourite thing in the world ever*</p>\n\n    <p>*inaccurate</p>\n\n    <p>We pottered down to breakfast and found that while the buffet accoutrements were present, you actually ordered your breakfast to be brought. We both ordered some scrambled eggs and helped ourselves to tea and juice, and I made some toast.</p>\n\n    <p>We were then brought plates of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and fruit platter. So that escalated fast.</p>\n\n    <p>We left most of the watermelon.</p>\n\n    <p>The tea was good though and we enjoyed a couple of small cups to prepare us for the day ahead.</p>\n\n    <p>We prepped some laundry to be done and then gathered our things to set out and explore the old town for the morning. I had thought it would be overcast - the weather forecast had been distinctly gloomy - but actually there was quite a lot of sun as we ventured forth for our riverside walk into Hoi An. We were back to a solid 33 degrees, feels like 39 with the humidity and sure enough, we were soon sweating.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52285014738_c41fd85639_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52285493200_59abcf0af1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We spent a pleasant morning pottering around amid the pretty yellow buildings, browsing the various stalls and poking our noses into this and that. And then retrieving them again quickly if the vendors proved particularly over keen. We visited the famous Japanese bridge which arced delicately over a small side river. Actually, we visited it twice as the first time it was so rammed with a tour group and people taking photos that we could barely get a look in. But having wandered around the block, it was then empty so we were able to get a better look.</p>\n        \n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52285273579_dc54839b9d_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Built in the 17th century, the carved wooden bridge was built by the Japanese to link up different parts of Hoi An more easily, and now stands as a monument to cooperation between the Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese. The entrance to the bridge was guarded on one side by a pair of dog gods and by a pair of monkey gods on the other, and in the middle of the bridge there was a smaller temple off to the side. We saw a sepia-toned photos from the beginning of the 20th century and it was comical to see that, again, the bridge was crowded and that some people had climbed over the bridge rails while others stood on the bank to be in the photo. In some ways, nothing changes.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52286416518_6ffc37bb60_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52285007066_3d0408100c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I picked up a few postcards in a print shop and managed not to buy some coasters even though I was tempted. However, the sun was starting to get the better of us and so we ducked into a cafe and had a sit down under a fan and a mango smoothie each. Which went down very well indeed.</p>\n\n    <p>This revived us enough that we went to explore the local food market. There were lots of food stalls, many occupied, and then these gave way to stalls which sold fruit and veg, or herbs and spices, various knick-knacks and then, finally, a meat section. We emerged from between the hacking meat cleavers back to the riverbank, and as it was quite scorching with the sun high in the sky, we decided to return to the hotel to spend the hottest part of the day indoors. Or possibly in the pool.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52285433787_6236db03ca_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We picked up a few snacks on our way to make a light lunch and we were absolutely ready for some air con and a cold shower when we got back to our room. Phew!</p>\n\n    <p>After a bit of a nibble and some journaling time, we decided to give the pool a try. It was a little chilly but it was nice to splash around for a while in the water.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52286416383_275c09b9bd_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52285439032_c5decb3e80_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Back in our room, we clocked up another episode of Lost with a brew and then got ready to head out for and celebrate Pete’s birthday! We walked back along the river into town and found the market considerably busier than when we left it. Strolling up and down the water’s edge in the old town, we looked for a bar that looked like it had a good view and settled on a roof terrace overlooking the bridge.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52285433962_7f45003495_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We were right: the view was great and we ordered a cocktail to toast the evening. Pete when for a pineapple mojito while I out away a banana mojito. Now before you judge, bear in mind that I was a bit incredulous too and mostly ordered it because it sounded weird. But it totally worked and had an almost creamy, banana edge to it. Yum!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287568206_414d4639e1_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We felt a spot or two of rain but remained undaunted on our terrace while other, chicken-hearted guests scuttled indoors. Our intrepid natures paid off and it stayed dry for our first and indeed second drinks. Double yum.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287833889_710a60fe1a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287832874_6077291728_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We just ignored the lightning which split the sky at regular intervals. Instead, it was lovely to chat and reminisce and laugh, reflecting over the last year and our plans for the next one.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288056915_b40cd24f10_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As dusk fell, the lights in the lanterns flickered to life setting a soft warmth emanating from the silk covers. Growing to a pleasant glow as the sky darkened, the lanterns were soon warming every shop front and the little boats began their nightly cycle up and down the river, reflections rippling in the water. While down on the street it was busy and bustling, it was so pleasant to be up on the roof observing from above.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287574023_9c45dbf521_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52286601067_df3a882847_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We decided to take a boat ride for ourselves and so left our lofty perch to mingle with the crowds below. We plucked some cash from an ATM, thrust about £6 at a boat chap and were soon on our way down the river. It was the same journey as the night before (although this time we bumped into three other boats) but it was lovely to have the little vessel to ourselves and watched the night time dance of lantern light on the water. Blissful.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287839399_b92cef14f2_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once we’d been ejected from our boat, we were ready to eat and so we headed into the night market. While definitely a market for tourists rather than locals, we were nonetheless happy to wander up and down, looking at lanterns and contemplating buying one to take home and pondering what we fancied for dinner.</p>\n\n    <p>And that’s when the heavens opened.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287587748_691c656f94_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We shrugged into our ponchos as there wasn’t much else we could do and made the distinctly damper walk up and down the rows of market stalls. However, neither of us found the stalls particularly enticing. There was a good deal of octopus on a stick (nope) and lots of banana pancakes and crepes and ice cream, but very little that said delicious Vietnamese morsel to us.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete hit upon a good plan though: he suggested we head for the famous banh mi place and try their sandwiches.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287840039_5667c1b405_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I was more than happy to do this and, as we knew they had indoor seating, it seemed a good option to get out of the rain.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287580058_7a1660572a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287840189_cd71eaeaaa_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>So we trooped through the dark streets until eventually we came to the right place: Banh Mi Phuong. This banh mi joint became super famous after Anthony Bourdain visited but according to our guide from the day before, she thought it was super touristy, claimed other banh mi was better and that locals didn’t eat there. Well, we were about to find out.</p>\n\n    <p>To be fair, she seemed to be right on some counts: the place seemed to be filled exclusively with tourists and the fact that the first thing on the menu was a burger made us judge them a bit. Plus, they had a picture of Anthony Bourdain on like, EVERY PAGE and it was weird.</p>\n\n    <p>Not even a good picture: a screenshot from YouTube with the play sign over the middle.</p>\n\n    <p>Super weird.</p>\n\n    <p>However, it was fast and cheap: Pete went for the pork option while I chose chicken and cheese and for less than £3 our dinner was served. Speedy! I was asked if I wanted spicy, and had to have that ludicrous conversation again where I specified that I liked spicy food and the server looked at me pityingly and said “so, medium?”. Sigh.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52288070560_ee057724b5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287589033_ae43518c44_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The sandwiches were indeed tasty. And not very spicy. The cheese in mine turned out to be cream cheese and it seems Laughing Cow is the business when it comes to cheese in Vietnam. The chicken was tasty though: tender but not dry, the added herbs had a good flavour and the sauce was very nice. Overall, a very solid banh mi indeed.</p>\n\n    <p>Just not as good as the one we’d had the day before. Sorry.</p>\n\n    <p>Good enough that we both ordered a second thigh: beef for Pete and a second chicken for me. Omnomnom.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287839959_958d3aa336_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was still raining when we left so we set out to walk back towards our hotel while keeping an eye out for a bar. We stuck to the river bank and while it was mostly quiet, there was the odd place here and there.</p>\n\n    <p>We ended up in a bit of a dive bar that Pete found: it was full of locals sitting round tables devouring food and drinking beer by the crate. It seems they would buy 24 bottles and after each one was finished, just chuck it on the floor. Great. However, there was also a big sign in gold on the wall saying happy birthday. Meant to be.</p>\n\n    <p>By heading inside I doubled the number of female customers but we pulled off our ponchos, decided to ignore the stray cockroach and ordered a Huda Gold beer each. Huda is a Vietnamese beer and apparently is favoured in Hue, but it’s also a Danish beer somehow. That’s all I know.</p>\n\n    <p>The Huda was tasty enough and gives you ample opportunity to make Huda man jokes, and Pete chased his first with a second.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287847924_c071ca3ba2_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>In the end, we decided to leave the locals to it and head back to our room for the night. A shower to wash off the rain and dirt was appreciated and we settled into bed to chill. I checked my email and found one that caught my attention.</p>\n\n    <p>Our flight home from Mauritius had been cancelled.</p>\n\n    <p>We spent the next hour or so researching our options and feeling alternately angry, frustrated, upset and despondent. We were given the option to request a refund (damn right I’m having a refund if you’re cancelling my flight) but no alternative travel options. Looking into booking a new flight at short notice, we found it was going to cost us over a thousand pounds more. Ouch.</p>\n\n    <p>I’m putting it mildly on purpose. We had rage.</p>\n\n    <p>There were literally no good options available to us that didn’t cost us a fortune and we were feeling so depressed the we gave up for the night and settled into somewhat muted activity, Pete on his laptop, me trying to write a chirpy journal. We’d have to work something out the next day. But given the problems we’d already encountered with the trip, it seemed extremely unfair that this had now landed on us.</p>\n\n    <p>I know we’re very fortunate blah blah blah, but it didn’t feel like it in the moment.</p>\n\n    <p>And it very much put a dampener on Pete’s birthday.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a quite round of tea and then settled down to bed. And that was that.</p>\n    \n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287586293_331c50c661_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    \n</section>",

        "content": "<section>\n        \n    <h1>Day 33</h1>\n\n    <p><span class=\"dropcap\">We</span> were up at 6:20 to greet a light drizzle and to hustle down to breakfast. By the time we’d eaten and Pete had packed himself some surreptitious bus sandwiches, it was absolutely pouring down. Great.</p>\n\n    <p>We packed up the last few things into our packs, checked out and then strapped our bags round us, pulling our billowing ponchos over the top. Then there was nothing for it but to step out into the downpour.</p>\n\n    <p>The torrent last just long enough to drench us through completely on our way to meet the bus. We sploshed along the street, puddles unavoidable due to the sheer volume of water that had called in the last couple of days and made it to the meeting point. This was another one of those buses where there isn’t really a bus stop or anything, just a vague address that doesn’t seem very promising when you arrive.</p>\n\n    <p>But arrive we did by 7:15 and we ducked under cover of a nearby hotel as the rain slowly petered out to a half hearted drizzle. We were stuffy and sweating under our ponchos, completely wet through and, admittedly, slight miffed. The bus wasn’t due until 8:00am, but according to the ticket boarding was at 7:30am and travellers were advised to arrive 30-60 minutes early in case the bus goes at a different time.</p>\n\n    <p>Like, really????</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, we waited for half an hour, hunched in our waterproofs, and then crossed the road to stand under the awning of a tourist tat shop for a bit. There were two other backpackers there and we asked if they were also heading to Hoi An; there were and this seemed a good sign.</p>\n\n    <p>A fraction before eight, a bus pulled up and while it had a different name to the one on our ticket, the drive me had a list with our names on. Winner. We piled on in, we’re given a small bottle of water each and then settled down for the journey. We didn’t set off until after eight and while we were relieved the bus had come, as Pete pointed out, it would be nice if you could just show up at the ticket time. We would have missed the worst of the rain that way.</p>\n\n    <p>Hoi An was reportedly a little over 3 hours away and so I switched on my audiobook and passed the time listening and dozing.</p>\n\n    <p>We pulled up finally in a nondescript car park in Hoi An and clambered out of the minibus and into our ponchos. The rain continued. I’m assuming everyone is the enjoying the “it’s raining” content as much as the “my goodness it’s warm” content. We were hoping to find a taxi but the car park was empty apart from a golf buggy, and there didn’t seem to be anyone around to ask.</p>\n\n    <p>But, joy of joys, the gold buggy turned out to be a taxi, and after a quick negotiation with the driver, we commandeered the little electric vehicle to take us to our hotel for £4. Bargain! As we drove through the streets and then alongside the lake, we saw lots of the little carts driving around and I wondered if these were the taxis of Hoi An and the city had adopted an electric vehicle policy.</p>\n\n    <p>We arrived at our hotel and checked in and after a short wait, we were shown to our room. We were feeling a bit sleepy but a cup of tea perked us up and we decided to work on a blog post in the hope that the rain would stop in the afternoon and we would be able to head out in the dry. After all, my app said at one o’clock it would stop raining.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course it was still raining at three so we sighed and donned our ponchos and set out anyway. We had a good tour booked for the evening which we were very much looking forward to, but we thought the walk into town would be a good way to help us find our bearings and get a bit of a feel for the town.</p>\n\n    <p>Our walk took us along the riverbank towards the old town; the water seemed a bit grey and the rain, and we were obliged to dodge puddles l and the odd bike and moped along the path. Almost as soon as we’d stepped out of our hotel, we acquired a curious shadow in the form of a young woman who peppered us with questions as we walked. She wanted to know where we were going, where we were staying, what we planned to do in Hoi An and how long we were staying. She also spent a while telling us about the tailoring shop her sister ran where she worked and encouraged us to come and have new clothes made. Hoi An is famous for its reams of tailors and having clothes custom made us practically tourist requirement. Eventually, our new friend wished us well and left the riverside path while we plodded onwards.</p>\n\n    <p>As we reached the outskirts of the old town, the rain had pretty much stopped and while stray raindrops would persist in dropping off the overhanging stalls, awnings and trees, it was nice to shrug out of my poncho; being encased in plastic just isn’t ideal when it’s so warm.</p>\n\n    <p>We wandered through a market lined with a real mix of wares: some very practical fruit and veg stalls and other geared very much towards tourists with magnets and jewellery and lanterns. Impatient motorbikes tried to make their way through the throng and it was slow going but there was lots to look at.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52282885398_3827b5481c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52283357125_805c44fe26_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Emerging from the market into the old town proper, we got our first look at Hoi An proper. And it really was a beautiful place! Probably the most famous tourist spot in Vietnam, Hoi An is filled with golden yelllow, French colonial buildings and while these days, most of the old town is given over to tourist cafes and shops, it is undeniably lovely. While loads of tourists did indeed flock about about, the atmosphere was cheerful and relaxed as people simply pottered around admiring the patchwork of streets and alleys. We crossed a bridge over the river just to see where it led, but on both sides, hawkers attempted to sell us boat rides, food stalls were cooking up of storm and riverside bars and cafes advertised their roof terraces. We were looking forward to exploring properly.</p>\n\n    <p>However, we had a food tour to get to: our guide had asked us to meet her at White Rose, which to me seemed a strange name for a Vietnamese food join and sounded more like a pub in Yorkshire. But Pete led the way and we were soon outside waiting to begin our culinary adventure. I was starving, having only eaten half a cereal bar since breakfast at half six that morning, and so even though 5:00pm seemed early for dinner, I was more than ready to munch!</p>\n\n    <p>Our guide, Vi, (Like the start of VIP, as she told us) came straight out of the restaurant to collect us and gathered us indoors to meet the third and final member of our tour group: a chap from Kuala Lumpur named Noel.</p>\n\n    <p>Time to learn a little more about the local dishes of Hoi An! The thing that was great about the tour was that it really focused on dishes that were important in Hoi An, either because they’re served on special occasions or because they’re local classics that people eat daily. White Rose it seemed specialised in the former.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52282885308_4140541afa_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52282871776_d43260e7cb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Vi explained that a white rose (or banh bao) is the name of a Vietnamese pork dumpling - suddenly giving the name of the restaurant a lot more context - and while they are served at various places in town, White Rose is the only place that makes them to a secret special recipe. A filling of pork, prawns and spring onion is nestled inside a flowing white rice flour case - hence the name - and then steamed before being served.</p>\n\n    <p>Vi told us that production was down since covid, with White Rose only making around 1000 dumplings a day to serve their own restaurant and the other restaurants in town, and we saw a table in the back of the shop where a team of women sat engaged in various parts of the dumpling making process. They also made vegetarian dumplings (banh vac) but these were sealed rather than open, and Vi told us they weren’t nearly as popular.</p>\n\n    <p>We grabbed a table and it wasn’t long before a place of dumplings arrived. Each! We had 4 of the pork and 2 of the vegetable ones to try and they were topped with a scattering of crispy shallots and served with a slightly spiced dipping sauce.</p>\n\n    <p>Oh my goodness they were tasty! I have to say the pork ones were definitely superior, but the soft dumplings with the crunch of the onions was just superb and the flavour was excellent: well seasoned and moreish. The dip was very good too.</p>\n\n    <p>We wolfed them down pretty quickly which was a good thing as our next dish arrived: hoanh thanh chien, a crispy wonton topped with prawns, vegetables and a sweet and sour sauce.</p>\n\n    <p>The wonton was deep fried and brittle - exactly the same dough as the steamed banh bao - but rendered completely different by the frying. Formed into a flattish triangle shaped, the toppings were sort of spooned over the top and Vi told us to pick it up like a slice of pizza. A couple of fat prawns nestled in among the spring onion, peppers, mushrooms and miscellaneous veg, and there were also chunks of pineapple. Pineapple juice was used to add sweetness to the sauce and overall it worked very well. A good balance of crunch and topping.</p>\n\n    <p>It had been an incredibly promising start to the food tour - I was really pleased we had been able to try banh bao as I had read about them and they were new to us - but it was time to move on in search of a new establishment and a new dish.</p>\n\n    <p>As we walked through the streets, dusk was falling and Vi explained that most food places only offer the one dish; they specialise in doing it a particular way and often there will be a lengthy cooking process or a lot of ingredients to develop and establish. I’m Vietnam, she told us that locals are often suspicious of places that offer too many different food options as they assume they aren’t being made properly. And it’s a valid point: why have loads of places serving mediocre dishes when you can have one place that can whip you up an exquisite portion?</p>\n\n    <p>Our next stop was to try cao lau - another dish I had read about and was eager to try and another dish that’s completely unique to Hoi An. Cao lau is a dish of pork, noodles, greens, rice crackers and broth. But surprisingly it’s the noodles that are the special ingredient. That’s for two reasons: they must be made with water from a particular well and the noodles are made of rice flour and the recipe involves a special herb that only grows nearby. Yikes.</p>\n\n    <p>Vi told us that one guy makes the noodles and then sells them at the market. Then traders will buy them and make them into cao lau: the broth might differ and so forth, but you have to have these special noodles.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52282885408_dc44f77d31_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52283357055_1d82f228db_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We received a bowl of cao lau each which Vi described as a small bowl of “mostly vegetables”. She was lying. She told us to add a squeeze of lime and some chilli paste and then to give the bowl a good mix: the broth was in the bottom of the bowl and it was supposed to coat and season everything.</p>\n\n    <p>The dish was delicious: the broth rich and savoury with a pleasant little kick from the chilli and the noodles were lovely: they were thick, a bit like udon, but with more bite so they didn’t go soft and mushy in the broth. Overall a strong dish. Yum!</p>\n\n    <p>Our next stop was for a Vietnamese favourite and we visited Madam Khanh. Otherwise known as the queen of banh mi. Promising. Now we were already fans of banh mi - fanh mi, if you will - but we had also read that the best banh mi of all is to be found in Hoi An.</p>\n\n    <p>Vi led us past the little cart at the front of the shop and into a small seating area behind. There we met the 87 year old business founder (Grandpa, apparently) who was busy preparing pickles and keeping an eye on his daughters and granddaughters who ran the stall.</p>\n\n    <p>So what made this banh mi joint special? According to Vi, it’s for a number of reasons. It’s wildly popular with locals as over the years, even thought it’s become relatively famous, they haven’t sold out and become touristy or large or - heaven forbid - started offering a menu catering to westerners. Additionally, their banh mi is always super fresh: the do pick ups of fresh bread every half hour or so from a local bakery instead of buying a job lot and letting it sit around all day. The bread itself is special and includes not just wheat flour but rice flour and - check this out - sweet potato flour. This means you get a lovely crunch on the crusty exterior, but a fluffy interior with air pockets ideal for stuffing with fillings.</p>\n\n    <p>Meanwhile, the fillings are made fresh throughout the day and so the end product is in theory nightly superior.</p>\n\n    <p>Vi grabbed 2 banh mi for us to share and we tackled half a sandwich each. They were the traditional pork banh mi but with the restaurants special way of preparing them, and so inside the fresh, warm bread we had pork, pork liver pate made with lemongrass, fried egg, pickled vegetables, coriander and some sort of sauce.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281892897_0f9c09035b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281895132_161378dd65_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was IMMENSE. Easily the best one we’d eaten and this is from someone who doesn’t like pate. The addition of the egg was a total treat, the flavours from the sauce and the herbs was fresh and spicy and complex and zingy and every good thing and the whole thing just SANG. I immediately knew I wanted to come back another time for more.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately for me, there was another half a sandwich left. But as we all expressed interest in sharing it, Vi simpler ordered a third banh mi and we ended up scoffing a whole one each. Heavenly.</p>\n\n    <p>There was another banh mi place in town that we had earmarked to try as it seemed to be the place to go. Vi mentioned it and said it was indeed very popular, but only with tourists. This place, it seemed, had done the unthinkable and expanded into offering a wider, diverse menu and she believed their product had suffered because of it. The stall had originally become famous after Anthony Bourdain visited, but Vi told us that during COVID, Madam Khanh did a roaring trade still with locals while the other place stood empty.</p>\n\n    <p>We reckoned we’d probably still try it, but it was interesting to get a local’s perspective.</p>\n\n    <p>At this point, Vi told us we’d had enough snacks and it was time for dinner.</p>\n\n    <p>Snacks? We’d already eaten 3 meals!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52282887508_495663a73a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52283143034_30d888ecdc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Dinner proved to be three different things at a little restaurant on the street of the famed well. Heading down a narrow alley festooned with lanterns, we popped into the little shop, guarded by a cardboard cut out of a lady holding a plate of food and scowling. We were given a big plate of food each and Vi talked us through the different components.</p>\n\n    <p>First up was banh xeo; these were the pancakes we’d tried in Hanoi and once again, we were advised to take a piece of pancake, wrap it with some salad in rice paper and eat it that way. I’m still going to say that in my opinion, the rice paper adds nothing and just means you make a mess everywhere. Rude.</p>\n\n    <p>The dipping sauce however, was amazing. It was a bit like satay, made with peanuts and happiness and sesame and Vi added to this some chilli paste and pickle lid shallots. If I’m completely honest, banh xeo doesn’t do it for me: it doesn’t have the flavour of so many other wonderful dishes we’ve had, and while a crispy pancake sounds really promising, the filling of beansprouts (too many beansprouts in my opinion) and a stray prawn is a bit underwhelming. Whereas I would eat the dipping sauce with a spoon quite happily.</p>\n\n    <p>The next food item on the plate was an old classic: spring rolls. Rather than having the usual minced filling, these had a single prawn inside. They were nice enough, and we ate them topped with pickled vegetables and sweet chilli sauce, but again, I felt I wanted more flavour. Plus we’d had the best spring rolls ever the night before so so Hoi An, but these aren’t going to cut it for me.</p>\n\n    <p>The final part of our dinner was barbecued pork. This sounds simple but was so beautifully prepared that it elevated a quick bite into something very delicious indeed. Pork belly had been marinated in honey, ginger, garlic, five spice and every food thing for goodness knows how long. Then a chopstick had been split down the middle, pieces of pork stuffed into the split and then the end had been bound with banana leaf. This was then char grilled and produced a resulting flavour that was smokey and rich and satisfying with meat that was incredibly tender and just melted off the chopsticks as we pried them apart. It was one of Pete’s favourite things of the night.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281892997_077653c1ee_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52282887473_ca0bc96682_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We left the little alley and made towards our final stop for tea and coffee. Vi had called ahead to ask the tea and coffee shop to prepare the drip coffee ahead, and when we arrived, I accepted the offer of dragon pearl jasmine tea instead. Drip coffee is the popular way to take it in Hoi An, a process which allows the coffee to slowly filter through; to me it tastes strong and dark - and extremely bitter but then I’m not a coffee fan. As we drank, we chatted, enjoying swapping stories about how we take out drinks. Vi told us that in Vietnam, the default for coffee is always iced (which might explain Pete’s iced coffee the other day in Hue) but we said we pretty much always want coffee hot. And tea, natch. We also shared our experiences of COVID; we’ve found that wherever we go, while everyone’s experience of the pandemic is of course individual, the very fact of living through it creates an expected but lovely shared bond. Wherever you’re from, being locked down just isn’t fun, and it’s fascinating to hear how people coped in different places.</p>\n\n    <p>Once we’d finished our drinks, Vi said that the weather was good so we were going to go and play bingo. This was a bit of a surprise for a good tour, but we trailed along in her wake and were soon back by the banks of the river, seated on little stools and holding bingo paddles. Each paddle had three worlds with an accompanying image and once all the paddles had been sold, the game began.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52283358995_e7acb27693_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281895112_cbac3c5c34_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was extremely odd. A couple stood at the front and sang along to a drum and stringed instrument played live by others, and as they sang, they drew words out of a pot. They would then finish the verse of the song with that word and if it was on your paddle, you waved and were given a yellow flag to hold. If you go all three of your words, you won.</p>\n\n    <p>We were a bit nonplused but the crowd seemed to be really into it and it was such a man unusual experience that mostly I just wanted to see what would happen.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281897287_0ab05a078c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281897282_fe15cb7698_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Of course, two of Pete’s words came up fairly quickly and I could practically see him dying inside and willing his third one not to come up. Further into the song, first one of mine and then another came up so we were both clutching two yellow flags apiece. We had no real means of picking out the words ourselves, but they would hold up the picture on the paddles too so that we could follow.</p>\n\n    <p>When Pete’s third word came up, I think he would have happily pretended he didn’t have it and let someone else win, but Vi was having non of it, waving excitedly. And so Pete had to go and have his photo taken while everyone clapped and cheered and he was presented with a lantern as his prize.</p>\n\n    <p>Truth be told, it was a little tacky, and announced him as a winner of the Hoi An Bingo. Or, “the art of Bai Choi the intangible cultural heritage of humanity”. Not my words. It was hilarious!</p>\n\n    <p>For our last stop of the night, Vi took us on one of the little boat trips on the river. These were sight to be seen as in the dark, the water and sky were inky while the river reflected the bright, beautiful silk lanterns that swayed merrily from shops, the bridge and the little boats themselves. It was like a scene from a film.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52283361415_7e11f6259e_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We stepped down into a little rowing boat with a lantern fore and aft, and spent about 15 minutes being rowed around a little circuit, weaving around all the other boats and basking in the glow of the rainbow orbs of light. We set little candles floating on the river and made a wish and it was lovely to soak up the atmosphere. I didn’t care if it was touristy: it was beautiful.</p>\n\n    <p>After our boat ride, we said goodbye to Vi and Pete and I strolled along the river. We stopped at a bar to have a drink and enjoyed a cold cocktail each, looking out over the river. It was refreshing and delicious; my cocktail was full of lime and lemongrass and kumquat and mint and it absolutely hit the spot.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52283144909_945231781d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52283361360_b42721c1c9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It felt much later than it was as we’d been out for a while, so we began our stroll home around nine, back through the little town towards our hotel. We stopped to pick up water and then at a second shop I decided to grab a packet of Oreos to go with our evening cuppa. Because 4 dinners is not enough (we didn’t even get dessert: rude).</p>\n\n    <p>Although, I should perhaps say in all seriousness, I enjoyed the Hoi An food tour more than the Hanoi one. I’m not sure if it was because the food was better or whether it chimed with things I really like to eat. Probably a bit of both! But it had been just excellent.</p>\n\n    <p>Meanwhile, back to the Oreos. I went to pay for them at the little counter and we were pounced on the owner who, in true Vietnamese style, had many questions for us about our trip and our plans for Hoi An. No matter how blatantly I proffered my money, she wouldn’t be stopped, giving us a map, explaining to us where to get Banh Mi (I told her we’d had it) and Cao Lau (again, she wasn’t put off by my assertion that we’d already had it) and where to get our clothes tailored. Apparently a personal recommendation was insufficient because this was followed up by a trip adviser search of the places she wanted us to go in order to prove they had five stars, and was accompanied by a general badmouthing of other places who were more famous and had five stars. She was indefatigable.</p>\n\n    <p>Some 45 minutes later (I think it must have been at least that) we stumbled out into the night clutching the biscuits. I wasn’t sure it had been worth it as while everyone we meet is invariably quite well-meaning, we just don’t want to buy all the stuff they’re trying to sell us. And it takes so long to put down the sales pitch, especially if you need something and can’t just walk away.</p>\n\n    <p>We made it back to our room and showered to rid ourselves of the night’s sticky humidity. Time to settle into bed with an episode of Lost, a round of tea and, of course, a hard won biscuit.</p>\n\n</section>",

And my goodness it was pouring down! We’d been pretty lucky with the rain during our trip as mostly we’d avoided it altogether, and the times it had rained, it hadn’t affected our plans. This day was going to be a little bit more interesting.</p>\n\n    <p>Breakfast was busy: loads of guests had come out of the woodwork and the restaurant was a hive of activity. I ticked into some eggs and rolls and egg fried rice because it was there and why not, while Pete loaded up on egg, bacon, sausage and bread rolls. He actually put the bacon and sausage into the rolls, claiming he was making banh mi. When I asked what made it banh mi instead of a breakfast butty, he held up his bread and explained “because this is banh and this is me”.</p>\n\n    <p>That settled it.</p>\n\n    <p>We returned to our room to have a brew and give the rain half an hour to ease, on the off chance. On the plus side, the temperature was a chilly 28. So, y’know, score.</p>\n\n    <p>The rain got worse, and one of the biggest thunderclaps I have ever heard exploded above us. The windows actually rattled, and lightening flashed.</p>\n\n    <p>So of course we deemed this a good time to gather our things and set off for the day. It didn’t look like things would get any better.</p>\n\n    <p>The hotel summoned up a taxi for us to make the short journey to the Imperial City - it was only a couple of kilometres away but given the downpour and the humidity, we decided to treat ourselves to the two quid for the ride so that we wouldn’t be already soaked and sweaty when we arrived. ROMANCE!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280168528_f3d37d501f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280150056_d256237da3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We jumped out of the cab at the entrance to Citadel (the Imperial City seems to go by both names) and dived into our super sexy ponchos. These seem to be the uniform here; on the roads, moped drivers were swaddled in them, many enfolding large sheets of the flapping plastic garments over the tops of their bikes and any passengers riding behind. It was almost comical to watch these colourful, amorphous shapes flailing down the roads, indifferent to the rain.</p>\n\n    <p>We bought our entrance tickets and were given a map of the complex, but we squirrelled these away inside our waterproofs before heading towards to the gates. How hard could it be to navigate an old palace?</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52279168307_37d7358e47_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280149976_ca85dfbb07_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Well, it turns out, quite tricky. The Citadel sits inside an enormous square moat and comprises so many different temples, pagodas, residences, pavilions, gardens and walkways that, by the end of our visit some 4 hours later, we weren’t 100% what we’d seen. Add in that much of it is constructed in a similar style and that the site is huge a sprawling and you have a recipe for confusion. We very much got lost.</p>\n\n    <p>We even tried using our maps app to navigate at one point, which is testament to the size of the place. So instead of running through a step by step tour of our experiences, I’m going to share a few overall impressions.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280415479_61296208fb_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The Imperial City was founded in 1802 when Nguyễn Ánh ascended the throne of a unified Vietnam. He proclaimed himself Emperor (modesty chap) and declared that Hue, the ancestral seat of the Nguyễn lords, was to be the capital. Thousands of workers were ordered to build the walled citadel and ringing moat which ran to over 6 miles in length. The entire complex was the seat of power until the French took a pop at running the show in the 1880s. After that, the citadel became mostly symbolic. Then in 1945 the Nguyễn dynasty was ousted with the advent of the Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>\n\n    <p>The Imperial city suffered from neglect, termites, challenging climate conditions (including a number of cyclones) and warfare. A battle in 1947 led to the destruction of many of the key buildings and much of the city was burned down.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280664825_3eff2684b7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280198228_d63858f17c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>However, rebuilding efforts and restoration have been going on - and are very much still underway - and there was still a vast amount of explore.</p>\n\n    <p>Lots of the buildings were painted a lovely, buttery yellow with carvings adoring the corners of the rooftops and framing the windows and doors. Dragons appeared everywhere, and we spotted quite a few phoenixes too (phoenices? Is it fancy plural?). Apparently, the phoenix often made its way onto women’s clothing, used as icon to represent good fortune, wealth and prosperity.</p>\n\n    <p>And presumably longevity?</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280150036_e9d698477e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280444399_5c6c9460ab_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Buildings were often housed within their own walled-off sections. Some of these were connected by roads (cue more of the ubiquitous golf buggies) and others by walkways. We sploshed along the former but traversed the latter with a little more dignity. Or at least as much dignity as you can muster when you’re hunched inside a pink, plastic poncho. The walkways were usually protected from the elements by high, vaulted ceilings constructed from dark, mahogany-coloured wood and screened with intricate shutters covered detailed picked out in a golden yellow.</p>\n\n    <p>We passed numerous framed photos and drawings of the emperors who had occupied the citadel over the centuries, as well as large display of archive documents showing where different emperors had annotated official documents over time. The emperors’ notes were always made in red over the top of the black writing and these always looked so beautiful with the artistic Chinese characters and the stamped seals.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280198188_10492064fe_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The rain continued unabated, sometimes slipping into a sullen drizzle and at other times working itself to a crescendo, accompanied by thunder and regular flashes of lightning.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280444419_e564ebbb82_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>There were lots of temples sprinkled through the citadel: these were in the style we were becoming familiar with: wooden carved pillars and screens painted red, gold Chinese characters, alters containing offerings and incense, sometimes to Buddha, sometimes to ancestors, and an endless parade of beautiful wooden lanterns, screened with panels covered in intricate blue dragons. To enter the temples, we had to take off our shoes and ponchos - no mean feat when your that damp.</p>\n\n    <p>After a couple of hours we stopped to regroup. We weren’t sure where we were or where we’d been so it took us a while to work out where we should head next. We must have figured it out as we did indeed end up in a new part of the Citadel but it may have been more by luck than by design. Hard to tell: Pete seemed to have a clearer sense of his orientation than I did.</p>\n\n    <p>We stopped for a break at a mini cafe sheltering underneath a pagoda. We grabbed a can of 7up each for energy and picked an ice cream: the Vietnamese version of a cornetto. Mine was pistachio and chocolate flavour, and my goodness it was tasty. Controversial opinion time: better than a real cornetto.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280672845_cf2d39745a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280444229_e5a34d7b1e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Despite having seen - and followed - several signs to the Purple Forbidden City, we weren’t sure whether we had passed through it or whether it was so forbidden we just couldn’t find it. I had imagined that you rock up to the gates and they say to you “Indigo!”</p>\n\n    <p>Trust me when I say that joke was brilliant when I said it out loud to Pete but that it’s somehow a bit pathetic written down.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280206463_6168e91658_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280206383_8e246cecd7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We emerged from the cafe into the royal gardens and these were fabulous: manmade pools carpeted with lilies and lotus blossoms framed delicate wooden pagodas while coy carp poked their heads out of the water to meet the rain with little fish kisses. Small foot bridges arched sedately over the water, walkways allowed us to stroll without getting even wetter (although, let’s be honest, there wasn’t much wetter we could get) and we even found a pavilion that had its own mini moat. You know you’re succeeding in life when you have a moat inside you moat.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete commented that he wondered if it was so small because it have been de-moat-ed.</p>\n\n    <p>(Full disclosure: Pete actually thought of this pun a few minutes after we’d seen the small moat but I told him I would write it into the journal as though it had been spontaneous. However, I find that now it comes to it, I cannot bear the burden of misleading generations to come.

Pete had a little go at winding the handle but there was no bucket on the string. “Well, well, well” was his contribution to the repartee we had established.</p>\n\n    <p>He meant well.</p>\n\n    <p>We had covered most of the Citadel grounds by this point (or at least, we thought we had: in all honesty, after you’ve been there for three and a half hours, it starts to look a bit same-y). Our last stop was at the royal theatre where we saw lots of costumes and photographs of cultural dances, all imbued with historical significance and which had names like “Gathering the best wishes for the Emperor dance” or “The four good fortunes and lanterns dance”. There was also a big drum and a large gong placed either side of the stage. I thought the presence of the gong would prove to much for Pete but I was wrong.</p>\n\n    <p>It was the drum that he couldn’t resist having a little go on.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280187361_949a80fa0a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280206373_ae657240f6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Feeling a little weary after doing the museum shuffle for several hours, we headed for the exit. Partly because we happened to pass a sign for it and figured that might be our best chance of escape. As Pete pointed out: it’s tiring looking at things. Plus, it was so wet and gloomy, we sort of felt we were done.</p>\n\n    <p>On the plus side, we were able to hail a taxi right outside the exit and we’re soon ensconced in our hotel room once more. We hung our dripping ponchos up, pleased to discover that most of our clothing was relatively dry, and after a hot shower apiece, we settled down to watch an episode of Lost with a cup of tea.</p>\n\n    <p>We spent the late afternoon researching and planning our trip to Hoi An for the next day and once it was time for dinner, we peered outside to see if the weather had improved. While it was tricky to tell, it looked like it might be dry. Ish. So we gathered up our ponchos and headed out into the night to investigate.</p>\n\n    <p>It had indeed stopped raining: everything was sodden and trees and shop awnings and overhangs dripped on us relentlessly, but it wasn’t raining, so we stuffed the ponchos into our bag and strode forth with a bit more of a spring in our collective step.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280187396_b1a067bdcc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280192876_139a20f5fc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I had found a place online called the Nook cafe that came recommended and while it took us a little while to find, when we located it, we found a cosy table with a bright, woven tablecloth and started perusing the menu. We split a frozen lime margarita which was yum, and ordered a beer each, and we started by splitting a portion of spring rolls.</p>\n\n    <p>They were the best spring roll we’d ever had. Fact. Oh my goodness, they were crispy without being oily, there was a great balance of filling and roll and the dipping sauce was perfection.</p>\n\n    <p>I told Pete I regretted sharing.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete ordered a chicken burger while I opted for a coconut curry. The waitress asked how spicy I wanted it and I said spicy. She seemed surprised and asked again: “Spicy?” And I concurred that, yes spicy was good.</p>\n\n    <p>“Soooo... medium?” She asked me again. Nope, I want it spicy! I’m not sure if she thought I was naive or if I would turn my nose up and leave the food, but I think I got my preference across. The curry turned out to be delicious and while it did have some spice, I wouldn’t have rated it more than a medium. So maybe I didn’t get my preferred across! Fortunately, it was delicious all the same.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete had a couple more beers while I ordered a banana, peanut butter and chocolate smoothie and a piece of banana cake with tapioca and peanuts served with coconut cream.</p>\n\n    <p>This was a little bit of a surprise: instead of being a cake with some tapioca, it was a slab of tapioca dessert. It was extremely glutinous and kind of claggy. A very strange texture indeed and definitely not cake. The flavour was good but I wouldn’t order it again. Pete was triumphant having been very anti any form of tapioca from the get go. Win some lose some!</p>\n\n    <p>After dinner we returned to our room for a cuppa. We had an early start to catch a bus the next morning and didn’t want to stay up too late. But then Pete suggested a final bonus cuppa and after a round of Milko Polo to establish whether we could find any more milk - we did - we snuggled into bed with our tea and an episode of Lost.</p>\n\n</section>",

This consumed, we scurried back to our room for tea and a more relaxed morning. It had rained quite a bit overnight and day was overcast. While it was still a solid 27 degrees (feels like 33 baby!) it was good to be out of the glare of the sun.</p>\n\n    <p>I know this seems like a lot of temperature chat but a) you know you love it, b) don’t pretend you don’t also tell people a lot when the temperature is noticeable and c) this is an accurate representation of things I said to Pete regularly on the trip. I think probably half a dozen time a day, I would comment “goodness, it’s warm!” and after while, I was obliged to amend this to: “I know I say this a lot, but goodness it’s warm!”.</p>\n\n    <p>Fascinating stuff. Pete is spellbound by my commentary every time.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273837789_a5a68834b2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52274065120_6711153c41_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The morning passed in a little flurry of tea drinking, changing into appropriately respectful Buddhist pagodawear ready for our afternoon and packing our bags so that they were ready to be stored for the day, unstored for the evening and then slightly repacked to accommodate our upcoming sleeper train journey. There is an art to arranging packing and while some days I have the knack of it, this particular day was complex, requiring various iterations of stuff to be carefully placed so that they’d be accessible without needing to empty out my whole backpack.</p>\n\n    <p>Again, more spellbinding commentary.</p>\n\n    <p>We had one last tea for elevensies before leaving behind our room and hunting down the hotel lady to check out. We settled our bill and following some smiling and miming alongside our request, managed to secure the chance to leave our bags for the afternoon and also use the shower post our afternoon out, which was very much appreciated.</p>\n\n    <p>We sauntered down the main road in search of some lunch, paying another visit to the ATM to withdraw more cash, and while loitering in tbr street trying to connect to a restaurant wifi and check how much was in each account, a motorbike pulled up alongside us.</p>\n\n    <p>A boy of about 12 hopped off the back and approached Pete slightly nervously, calling him sir and asking if he could practise his English. Pete was a little taken aback but agreed, and there followed a short interview where Pete was asked his name, age, his thoughts on Vietnam, his itinerary, his home and various opinions. Then the boy got back on the motorbike and was driven away. Brilliant.</p>\n\n    <p>Money acquired, it was time for lunch and in the end we settled for the banh mi place we’d visited at lunch time the day before. This time we sat in to eat, and watched the busy trade the little banh mi cart was doing. It was a funny little place, with the banh mi cart out the front, a covered seating area behind it and a tiny spa in the back. A bit of a jack of all trades but the banh mi was super yummy, Pete opting for a pair of chicken ones while I ordered a garlic banh mi. Just seemed like a good idea.</p>\n\n    <p>I also had a banana passionfruit smoothie which was divine - so refreshing and sweet without being sickly.</p>\n\n    <p>I helped Pete out with his Wordle (I think that’s 3 of them I’ve got now, which isn’t bad for someone who doesn’t play) and then we walked back to our hotel to meet our lift for the afternoon.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273837599_5298239abb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273578801_19a26fe673_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The driver was already waiting for us so we were able to depart a little early on our way to Bai Dinh Pagoda. Situated some 20km away, Bai Dinh is the biggest temple complex in Vietnam, and while nowadays, most of the structure is new, being build between 2003 and 2010, the original temple from way back when is actually up a hillside a little way away. Bai Dinh is a pilgrimage site for Buddhists and we found out that it’s also a UNESCO world heritage site.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273838759_bd17e360e3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272613077_7fd1727e4d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our driver dropped us off at the ticket office, promising to be back three hours later to collect us, and we ventured inside. We were immediately pounced on by an extremely assertive ticket lady who took us through an immense number of ticket options very quickly, before focusing in particular on the VIP ticket. We hadn’t quite expected the onslaught so we had to slow her down and go back to cheap options: all we really wanted was a ticket to enter. In the end, we sprung for the entry and the return journey to the gate via electric golf cart.</p>\n\n    <p>Bear with me as I know that sounds mad, but the actual entrance to the pagoda was a mile or so along a road from the ticket office. It all seemed to be part of the land of the complex but as we perched on the back of the golf buggy, it was clear that literally no one was walking and that it would have been quite a long and tedious trek given the humidity.</p>\n\n    <p>So a good move to get the ride there and back, but a bit strange that they couldn’t just make that part of the ticket, or maybe even put the ticket office at the entrance.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272612877_63b6a9a4e2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273847234_d059bd60c4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Anyway, we arrived at the gates ready to explore the temple complex. And it was indeed huge as advertised: most of the complex was set between two parallel covered walkways, and these sloped up the hill, broken at regular intervals by staircases to make the ascent. Covered walkways is a misleading term though as these were pretty grandiose: open to the temples on one side, the other was completely covered in little nooks which contained golden Buddha statues, and these disappeared off into the distance along the wall as far as the eye could see. There must have been thousands of them. There were also a series of big stone carvings of Buddha, adopting various poses and expressions and we wandered along slowly peering at them and wondering what the significance was of their poses.</p>\n\n    <p>The long corridors were dim and quiet, piped music was playing to set the scene and the atmosphere was peaceful and dignified, serious and reflective.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273605758_0e82c57530_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52279212332_83ae618412_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our first port of call was in the giant bell tower which contained, much to Pete’s delight, the biggest bell in the country. Sadly it was suspended out of reach and Pete didn’t get to dong it, but I think if he’d really wanted to, he could have unhooked the giant dingy thing that always chained up at the side. A tempting proposition.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272632897_210a260c1b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273626173_f445090df0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The pagoda containing the bell was build of beautiful dark wood and had a lovely, tactile appearance, smooth and somehow reassuring. The temple complex in general didn’t seem to be big on signs or information; while I had heard the odd fact regarding the size of the bell, I couldn’t remember if it was the largest in Vietnam or possibly had a bigger claim to fame.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272605097_b7886337d7_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n\n    <p>Our next stop was at the first of the temples: these were all similar in structure, the altars residing in huge, high-ceiling if wooden halls with the now-expected offerings of tons of biscuits and fruit and canned drinks laid out before them. Incense burned, we spotted the familiar crane statue standing on a tortoise, and in this temple, a giant golden statue of Buddha presided.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273868189_c20e2c7570_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273868194_b5aa51b09d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>At least, we think it could have been Buddha but it had about 30 arms, so then again, maybe not.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273887589_1a4f925417_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273626198_f47351e01d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>However, this was dwarfed by the Buddha statue in temple number two. The largest in the complex, this one was definitely Buddha doing a classic pose and holding a lotus. The gold of the statue glimmered in the dark hall and ornate wooden screens carved into red and and gold twining dragons descended from the ceiling to frame it. The dragons had inlaid, glittering eyes and actually they were my favourite part of the temple.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272652552_437fc40e96_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Returning to the covered walkway, we continue to climb the stairs until we finally reached the last and biggest temple. A huge square was opened out in front of it and golf buggies beetles around dropping off tourists; it seemed that if you didn’t want to walk between temples, you could pay extra to be driven, that that seemed a step too far into crazy for us.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52274114105_7854cea2e0_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>A large staircase swept up to the temple sporting lovely flowing dragon carvings, and in front was a tableau of a big laughing Buddha flanked by two large bonsai trees. I appreciate saying a large bonsai sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but that’s exactly what these were: really enormous trees rendered in minute. Little model scenes had been set into them and they were charming and delicate. Definite future garden goals.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273627341_eb85a23a7e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273887789_41a2abd6f7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n \n    <p>Inside the temple were the usual array of offerings, red and gold pillars and carved screens. But this one had 3 large, gold Buddha statues, each making a different hand sign. Pete explained that this represented three different ages of Buddha, my favourite being the final “high five” age. But equally, Pete may have been making it up.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273662843_628d4870cc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273893304_6078381f8a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>He did have a mini ring of the large temple bell, but very quietly, and he found a large pot which he claimed he would fit into but was reluctant to prove it.

It looked a bit like they were all on a Ferris wheel. They all seemed happy about it though.</p>\n\n    <p>Flanking the statues were a series of carvings of warriors, rendered in dark stone. Each one looked aggressive, clad in armour and clearly meant to intimidate and impress with their power. It was interesting to see that each of the warriors had a large round belly and some extra chins: a decent quantity of bulk. Just shows how perceptions change of what is seen to be impressive and powerful.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273904554_5a811dab1a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272669492_836bf86753_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We left the temple and moved towards the opposite walkway to the one we had ascended, this time heading back down the hillside. Our first stop on this side was the huge tower which dominated the complex. Some 14 stories high (or thereabouts) there was a lift inside that could transport you to the top for views over the whole complex.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52274131155_6dc2cbf45a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272674642_fe65c5a2bf_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>At the entrance to the tower, our tickets were checked and stamped and we had to put little elasticated bags over our feet to protect the floor. Pete’s were in tow wildly contrasting fabrics and while mine matched, one had lost its elastic so it was like trying to walk in a carrier bag. Classy!</p>\n\n    <p>We had to shuffle up one floor of marble stairs to the lift; we wondered how necessary the bags were or whether they’d just hit on a great way to save polishing the floor. The lift area was very grandiose, all gleaming marble and bright white, chiselled walls. But it also had a slight hotel lobby vibe, there was no way around it.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273649681_77f4f0e44a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272674672_10e7339f34_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n    <p>The lift sped us up to the top and we stepped out onto a little balcony that ran around the top. We could indeed see the whole complex mapped out below us, and we gained appreciate for the size of the place. Other directions yielded views over lakes and the limestone peaks jutting out of the land here and there. There was a bit of a breeze which was a relief after the still, muggy, humidity-saturated air we’d been swimming through and we admired the scenery from all angles.</p>\n\n    <p>It turned out that we could go up one more floor, and in the top of the tower, there was a shrine with a Buddha carved from coloured stone, nestled in an alcove and surrounded by offerings. Atop the shrine was a multicoloured flashing disco light but we’ll forgive that lapse in taste. We also spotted the couple who had tailed us from Hanoi but they didn’t see us #stealthytimes</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273649111_7c1f53c7b0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273909809_b2ff02c8f3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We finally descended the tower and began the walk back to the golf buggy station. On the way, we stopped at another smaller tower, took a detour over some grass to another shrine to three figures (probably not the 3 wise men but that’s what it looked like) and then, as I was saying to Pete that I thought we should probably stick to the path, a paved path appeared.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52274136090_b29413855c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273664491_fd12ccd253_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We wandered down to one final temple - featuring a rather nice teapot with two spouts, or at least something that looked like that - and then we came out at a large, square pool, sunk carefully into the stone. It was still and a small pagoda stood in the centre.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52274151790_0a663d2df0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272690222_2cd2fed41f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As we approached the edge of the water, hoards of fish swarmed towards us; there were loads of them in every colour and they ruffled the surface of the water - possibly hoping to be fed? We weren’t sure, but as we walked around the pool, they followed us in a large, thronging school, rippling and thrashing as they went.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52274151835_0f257781d7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273681493_b60c4a43cf_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We reached the golf carts and once enough other visitors had boarded our vehicle, we set off to drive back to the entrance. Of course, the buggy stopped short of the ticket office obliging is to walk through a passage lined with stalls all trying to sell various knick-knacks but we escaped relatively unscathed and I popped to use the loos, leaving Pete with the bag and my phone. I later learned he had snapped an odd set of pictures - why would he get a picture of me leaving the toilets??? - but at the time, I simply gathered up my things and pressed on as we found our driver ready and good to go.</p>\n\n    <p>We enjoyed the cool air con on the drive back to Tam Coc. We were dropped at our hotel and the hotel lady very kindly let us use her shower; even though the day had been overcast, the humidity still make us sweat profusely so it was a relief to feel a bit cleaner for the evening.</p>\n\n    <p>We gathered our backpacks and loaded ourselves up for the evening before setting out to find some drinks and some wifi. We decided to hit our usual drinks place - I love staying somewhere long enough to have a usual - as the wifi was reliable and the drinks were tasty.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a smoothie each and I also order a tea. Pete warned me not to as he was convinced I wouldn’t get what I wanted (occupational hazard of being outside the U.K.) but I felt like it was meant to be. So as per the menu, I order Lipton tea, hot, with a bit of milk.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272689592_4b9f343876_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273664916_a6d24cc8a6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>What arrived was unusual: one of the most creative interpretations of a cup of tea that I’ve seen. It was served in a glass. With a curly straw and a cocktail stirrer.</p>\n\n    <p>To be fair, it was warm, it was a Lipton teabag so it was actually black English breakfast tea, and they had added milk. But there was also a metric shedload of sugar which made it sickly. I drank it anyway, but Pete was proved correct in his advice.</p>\n\n    <p>We worked on a couple of blog posts and then returned to the Farm restaurant for dinner: that had been my favourite of the places we’d eaten. The waitress recognised us and found us a table, eyeing up our backpacks and asking about our onward plans. We settled into a booth and we both ordered chips (they were consistently incredible) and then Pete went for spring rolls while I decided to go for chicken pho. I’d decided that we’d been in Vietnam too long not to have ordered some pho: it’s basically the National dish.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete is less keen on noodle soups, commenting that it wouldn’t be his “pho-st” choice but it was tasty and filling and while I think I prefer my pho spicier and with a greater depth of flavour, I enjoyed it. Slurrrrrp! It did, however, take quite an extended series of mimes and gestures at various cutlery to indicate I wanted spoon - chopsticks just don’t cut it when it comes to soup.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a couple of hours to kill until we needed to head for the train station, and so we lingered in the cafe, watching as the rain fell on and off, reading and catching up with my journal.</p>\n\n    <p>We had booked a taxi to take us from our hotel to the station at eleven, so at half ten, we laid our bill and set out into the dark, rainy evening to meet out ride. However, when we got to the hotel, the lady who ran it met us and someone had been looking for us to drive us. We were a bit surprised as we were a good half hour early, but she said not to worry and she’d call him.</p>\n\n    <p>And then she put up an umbrella and cycled off into the night.</p>\n\n    <p>We were a little confused to say the least. A few minutes later she returned, but then cycled away again; our only recourse was to sit and wait. After all, if nothing happened, we could always go back to the main road and see if someone could call us a taxi. The waitress at the restaurant had offered to so we were pretty confident we could work something out somewhere.</p>\n\n    <p>However, this was all unnecessary: our driver was summoned out of the night, we thanked our hostess and we were whisked to Ninh Binh station, arriving a little after eleven.</p>\n\n    <p>It was a little strange: after the continued hive of activity everywhere we went, the streets were deserted and mostly unlit. The station was quiet: everything closed and shut up and the platform gated off. As we ventured into the forecourt, we found a couple resting on the plastic seats; this was a little reassuring as at least we weren’t the only ones expecting a train.</p>\n\n    <p>I realised the platform barriers weren’t locked so we could in theory get to the tracks, but our train wasn’t due until half midnight, so plonked ourselves down to read and wait.</p>\n\n    <p>A family of four showed up a while later - again, encouraging - and time ticked slowly on. The forecourt filled up around us, the clock passed midnight, I swapped my sandals for shoes as the rain had made my feet wet and we waited.</p>\n\n    <p>A train rumbled into the station and stopped, awaking a flicker of interest and a mini flurry of activity as passengers can myself included, went over to the platform barrier to peer out. It was about 20 minutes early but even so, we wondered if it might be the one we wanted in the silent, unmanned station. But it was only a cargo train.</p>\n\n    <p>Around ten minutes before our slotted time, the PA system crackled to life and did indeed finally announce our train, first in Vietnamese and then in English. Not only that, 2 guards appeared out of the gloom beyond the platform to check our tickets and point the way.</p>\n\n    <p>We all shuffled along the damp platform hauling our backpacks and looking for the best spot to meet our carriages. A little while later, bright lights appeared along the direction of the track marked “Hanoi”, trundling slowly in the “Ho Chi Minh” direction. Our train was here.</p>\n\n    <p>Train conductors on board we’re busily flicking out little signs which marked the carriages and we found number 8, showed our ticket and clambered on board. Ours was the first compartment we came to, and after I’d worked out how to open the door, we found the allotted 4 beds inside, 2 occupied by 3 people who were almost asleep: a mum and her 2 kids. There was nothing for it but to squeeze our bags under the bed, pop quickly to the loo and then hop straight into our bunks. It was gloomy but the light from the corridors was enough to see by. There wasn’t a ladder up to the top bunk but I stood on the table to climb into bed, grabbing my hoodie for warmth as the train was quite chilly.</p>\n\n    <p>I told you packing things in easily grabable order was important: I would have been cold without my hoodie but there was barely room to move in the compartment, never mind institute a grand unpack. In the dark.</p>\n\n    <p>I kissed Pete good night and settled down. The bunks were small - my feet easily reached the end and lying on my side, my knee was wedged against the wall while my elbow was jammed against the barrier to stop me from falling out. The train was noisy: something of an ancient beast, it rattled and swayed and while I can’t honestly say it’s the nicest sleeper train I’ve been on (by quite a long chalk) I did doze off to the movement and pattern of shadow on the ceiling.</p>\n\n    <p>Nothing says honeymoon like sharing a cramped compartment for 4 among 5 people. Romance five!</p>\n\n    <h1>Day 31</h1>\n\n    <p>I slept reasonably well given the circumstances, waking up to turn over every so often before being jolted awake at six by an announcement that went on and on and on, repeated over and over by a stern-voiced guard. I had no idea what it was about. Unbelievably, this was then followed up by a series of banging Vietnamese pop tunes, blasted at full volume over the tannoy.</p>\n\n    <p>WHY???</p>\n\n    <p>After a time, the volume was reduced and a song or two later, the cacophony was switched off entirely. Thank goodness. I managed to catch a little more sleep, dozing on and off, and then awoke properly at nine thirty. I had thought this was around our arrival time and panicked slightly, but when I checked where we were on the map, we were still over a 100km from Hue.</p>\n\n    <p>Peering down to the bunk below, I found Pete was awake and reading and he helped me down so I could pop to the loo. It seemed the compartments didn’t do converting to day seats so I scrambled back to the upper bunk to read too.</p>\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52273694103_7d3533ae20_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The kids alternated between snacking and reading (the older was lugging around a Vietnamese copy of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) and also running around and screaming, which I could have lived without. But hey ho: there’s always an upside and I found a Kit Kat in my handbag to eat. So winning.</p>\n\n    <p>I finished my book and set about editing a few photos from our time in Tam Coc until the train conductor turfed me out of my bunk to set it up for the next passengers. I perched alongside Pete in the bottom berth until we pulled into Hue, a little after noon and almost twelve hours after we’d set off.</p>\n\n    <p>Hauling our bags down to the platform and leaving the station, we were accosted by motorbike drivers all wanting to give us a lift. We turned them all away one by one; they were surprisingly insistent, telling us a taxi would be much more expensive, twice the price and so on. By my reckoning, I thought we could get one taxi for less than the cost of two bikes as our hotel wasn’t far away and I didn’t feel that my first time riding on the back of a motorbike should be when I also had 15kg of luggage strapped to me. Just an observation.</p>\n\n    <p>We did eventually swing a taxi - for quite a bit less than the bike drivers had prophesied - and we pulled into our hotel a few minutes later. It was scorcher so we were glad to duck inside and we were soon checked and given the keys to our room.</p>\n\n    <p>Apropos of nothing, if you’re ever in Vietnam and in need of wifi, literally every password seems to be either “12345678” or “weloveyou”. That’s a top travel tip brought to you by Kirsty.</p>\n\n    <p>We were quite thirsty by this point and devoured the little bottles of free water that had been provided, before indulging in a good shower to properly shake off the train and refresh us for the day. We did a little bit of Hue research and book our onward travel to Hanoi for a couple of days’ time, and then, as I was pretty much dead from thirst, we set out into the city.</p>\n\n    <p>We decided to stop by a cafe first, and I’d looked up a little coffee shop that apparently sold drinks and cakes. This didn’t disappoint and we were soon ensconced with an accidental iced coffee for Pete (he’d been expecting a latte) and a chocolate cookie crumble milkshake for me, which was divine. Pete opted for cheesecake, I had a banana muffin, and it all did wonders to perk us up and supply us with a bit of energy.</p>\n\n    <p>The city of Hue is based around the wide Perfume River which sweeps through it and so we decided to spend the afternoon walking along its banks and getting a feel for the place. It was - obviously - warm and sticky, but we strolled along anyway, starting by waking through a small park that lay along the bank, grateful for the shade the trees provided here and there.</p>\n\n    <p>At the first bridge, we decided to cross the river and continue our walk on the opposite bank. The roads were busy and crossing was a challenge but eventually we just decided to launch out into it, allowing it to flow around us. The key seems to be not to overthink things.</p>\n\n    <p>Once we’d crossed, we followed the pathway further upriver and I was surprised by how open it was. I had been half expecting a parade of shops and stalls, restaurants and bars, all attempting to ply a riverside trade, but instead there was a wide path divided for pedestrians and cyclists and we followed this onwards. We passed under a second bridge which crossed the river, wander past a little pavilion, dodged round kids on roller blades and watched the dragon boats tooling up and down the waterways, selling rides to tourists. And of course we had a little go on the outdoor gym equipment just to make sure we were in good shape.</p>\n\n    <p>At around quarter past four, we figured we’d gone far enough and turned around to retrace our steps. The sun was now partially obscured by cloud and had dropped lower in the sky so the heat wasn’t quite so intense. Through the gaps in the road we could see glimpses of the imperial palace we had decided to visit the next day and even though there was lots of traffic and an unrelenting chorus of beeping from motorbikes, the river walkway itself was peaceful.</p>\n\n    <p>We decided to cross back over the river on the second bridge and take in more of the river on that side. There was, thankfully, a pavement alongside the traffic. I spotted a road sign marking a fork for the vehicles which pounded their way over over the bridge. They could either turn right and head to a destination 1km away. Or they could take the left fork and go to Hanoi, 643km away.</p>\n\n    <p>That’s really not a decision you want to get wrong if those are your only options.</p>\n\n    <p>We followed a wooden boardwalk that had been build out over the river for pedestrians. Lots of locals and visitors were perched on the side posing for photos and we saw no less than three brides having photographs there as well. It must be a thing. More excitingly, I spotted a group of Vietnamese guides - I wanted to ask for a selfie (I got the impression that the request would have gone down pretty well) but they were in the middle of having a saluting sort of ceremony so I didn’t want to interrupt. There was a unit of younger girls too engaged in a singing and action song or game or something, and they had the most brilliant dungarees as part of their uniform. Envy.</p>\n\n    <p>We picked up some water at the nearest local shop we could find (the first two I had earmarked were either shut down or non-existent and the Greenmart, where we ended up, was underwhelming to say the least) and returned to our hotel. As we felt warm and sticky from the humidity, Pete suggested a dip in the pool.</p>\n\n    <p>It was empty when we arrived and we had a lovely time swimming about. The sun was low enough in the sky that while it provided warmth and light, we were in no risk of sunburn and we enjoyed having the whole pool to ourselves. Clearly other guests had the same idea: 15 minutes later, a dozen or so other people had come to swim, bringing children and floats and paraphernalia and it got quite crowded.</p>\n\n    <p>Returning to our room, I made a round of tea - my first of the day and I gave myself snaps for lasting that long - and Pete found a packet of Oreos in his bag. Because the white witch, while she had some problems in the morals and turning-people-to-stone department, was right when she said “it is dull, son of Adam, to drink without eating”.</p>\n\n    <p>I had a second biscuit.</p>\n\n    <p>Around seven, we ventured forth to hunt down something to eat. We hadn’t really had a proper meal, but equally, we were a little sleepy from our night time train adventure. Pete remembered spotting a pizza cart just beyond our hotel, so we pottered down the street and found it. It was one cart of three, comprising a tiny food court of sorts with a few tables and chairs set out for diners. We ordered a pizza each (it was either that or frog congee from the neighbouring stall and for some reason, neither of us were in the mood for frog) and attempted to order a drink. I say attempted: after picking a coke and a juice, the stall holder came back to say they had no soft drinks, so would Pete mind having water. Then she came back again and said there was also no juice. Water all round!</p>\n\n    <p>The pizzas were hot, cooked to order and pretty tasty, and we were glad to have found something quick, easy and cheap so nearby. Then we returned to our room at the grand old time of roughly 8:15pm to have tea and try and stay awake long enough to watch an episode of Lost in bed.</p>\n\n    <p>And to have another cup of tea.</p>\n\n    <p>And a bed time biscuit (see information concerning drinks and eating above).</p>\n\n</section>",

Even the “feels like” section of my weather report reckoned that with the humidity, we’d be feeling like it was around 35. Noticeably more manageable!</p>\n\n    <p>With our bag packed, we stepped out into the street and discovered that a few drops of rain were coming down here and there. However, it didn’t bother us as we weren’t exactly going to be getting cold and damp, so we wandered up to the main road in search of bikes.</p>\n\n    <p>We were planning to visit the Mua Cave and viewpoint which was about 5km away, and as we’d been told the best way to get one was by bike, we first needed to find a bike. Actually, two bikes.</p>\n\n    <p>We’d only passed a handful of shops before we spotted the first bike rental sign and a whole bunch of bicycles lined up of the pavement. A lady came scurrying out of the back of the shop at our interest and hired us a park of bikes for the day for less than £4. Bargain.</p>\n\n    <p>Not so much with the helmets though.</p>\n\n    <p>She wanted a passport to use as a deposit but we didn’t have them on us, and seemed happy to take my driving licence instead. And so we raised the kick stands (they were on the rusty side so this was an effort and the bike lady had to beat mine into submission) and wheeled the bikes out into the road.</p>\n\n    <p>While the bikes were certainly old, they were cheap and worked perfectly well. There were no gears which I think Pete would have liked, but so didn’t really care as the pedalling was easy and the route was completely flat. In Vietnam, they drive on the right, so we pedalled to the right hand side of the road through the village and set forth on our mission.</p>\n\n    <p>I was navigating leaving Pete free to ring his bell at everyone who went past, particular then motorbikes who are incapable of riding their vehicles without also riding the horn. At least you know they’re coming, and Pete was having a lovely time dinging at everyone. My bell didn’t work, but I didn’t think that really mattered.</p>\n\n    <p>I’d looked up two possible routes: the first shorter and recommended by Google maps for people on food, the second longer and recommended by Maps.Me for cyclists. Google is often the more reliable when it comes to locations, whereas Maps.Me tends to do better when we’re off the beaten track, an indeed in this case, it was right on the money. While Google’s route might have worked on foot, the terrain would almost certainly have rattled our ancient bikes to pieces as road turned into I paved track very quickly. I backtracked us to the road and we stuck to our new route.</p>\n\n    <p>I had wondered if we’d find cycling difficult in the heat, but it was quite the contrary! Requiring minimal effort to get quite a distance, the bikes just seemed to roll along of their own accord and, which was a big selling point for me, because we could propel ourselves along at a pace much faster than walking, cycling created its own breeze! Blissful!</p>\n\n    <p>All this time, I’d thought the Tour de France riders had it so rough, and it turns out instead of putting in the hard work and hiking in the heat, they’re just winging along feeling all chill with nature’s air con. After 10 minutes or so on the bike, I was pretty sure that Tour de France would pose no problems for me whatsoever. May as well hand over that yellow jersey now.</p>\n\n    <p>The journey flew by as we cycled through the village into a more residential area, past a local graveyard, and a bus station that actually wasn’t a bus station but a parking lot where double decker buses had been parked up and turned into bars and karaoke venues. In fact, we passed quite a few karaoke places: seemed to be a thing in Tam Coc.</p>\n\n    <p>Soon we were out among rice fields, a herd of goats clogging a footpath as they dealt with the undergrowth, and several fields of lotus flowers, stretching out of the water. These often had signs and frames for people to take pictures with, but we also passed a large sign that said LOVE which backed onto an empty field of swampy mud. Takes all sorts.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete was of course super keen to stop at all of these points, but we kept true, barrelling down on our destination.</p>\n\n    <p>When we turned into the right road, there were lots of areas cleared on either side bike and motorbike parking, and as we cycled through, the proprietor of each one would stand in middle of the road, almost trying to physically block our bikes from going further in an attempt to sell us their parking.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete was unperturbed by this and could not be diverted from his mission, and I just cycled after Pete - handy - so we made it to the entrance where we had to pay 20 000 dong each to leave our bikes. Fair play: less than a pound a go. Pricey by Holmfirth Coop standards though.</p>\n\n    <p>Our bottoms were a little sore but other than that, we felt good after our ride and were looking forward to exploring the cave and viewpoints. So we paid our entrance fee and ventured forth.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269370848_3a0573096b_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>A path ran towards the jutting limestone outcrop ahead: the very one we would be climbing to get to the viewpoint. The path followed a small stream and at regular intervals, there were stepping stones over the small seating areas, or little shops and cafes. We passed all these until we reached the cliffs and after a brief debate, decided to climb to the viewpoint first before visiting the cave. We thought we may as well make the most of the cooler air.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269370788_29f38fc89d_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The climb was steep and with almost 500 steps to conquer, no mean feat. But we set off slowly and steadily plodding upwards, and we gained height quickly as the steps zigzagged back and forth up the steep, jagged cliff. The views started laying themselves out beneath us and even thought the steps were uneven and often large, I didn’t feel nearly as wiped out as I did by our short temple climb the day before.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269621469_ec51fd744c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52268390802_01e637998c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Roughly two thirds of the way up, the path split heading towards two different peaks which yielded two different views. We went for the taller of the two first and emerged at a platform a little way before the summit. We could see the green rice fields stretching out below us, some lush and ready, others sparse and new, with water ways snaking their course through the wetlands. Limestone mountains jutted suddenly from the flat, valley floor and we could make out some tiny rowing boats following a course through the lagoons.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52271126757_d728601f3b_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Actually, I say tiny rowing boats: it’s more likely that they were normal size and far away.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52271126627_51fe74057f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272356384_d0f784a2c3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Climbing up the final stretch, we made it to the summit of our limestone peak. It was ornamented with a long, stylised dragon statue and we clambered around the top of the rock, gripping into the black stone which was both jagged and angular, and yet worn smooth over time. The views really were incredible and it felt like we were getting the aerial perspective on the landscape carpeting the world below. Rice fields and lotus blossoms filled every available flat piece of land and the sharp angles of the limestone cliffs were in stark contrast to the smooth path of the agriculture. Just beautiful.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272586410_eb9e564b11_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272116363_43b212f1d4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>With one peak conquered, we set out to climb the second. This one was not quite as high, but we were still sweating buckets once we’d reached the top.

Following the sings, we found the entrance and ventured inside but if I’m complete honest, they were a little disappointing. There was one short passage with a door at the end leading to an underground pool - it was neither large nor particularly ornate, and there were more big vats of wine stored inside.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52271163862_c742baf478_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272153983_8428bb1485_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The larger cave wasn’t really a cave at all, but a short tunnel, arching through the rock out to the wetlands beyond.

Again, lots of people were clustered around taking pictures and Pete wondered if they were there purely to look picturesque. I wasn’t convinced and looking it up later, found that lotus seeds are harvested and used for all sorts of things in Vietnam. It’s a reasonably standard crop.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272632090_cc753c8c21_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272141246_9924db3a69_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The blooms were beautiful though, stretching out of the water, big blousy petals opening of the sky, while delicate pools of water collected in the leaves, icy in their clarity.</p>\n\n    <p>We picked up our bikes and rode back into Tam Coc, Pete dinging his bell at regular intervals and even more so once we passed a sign saying no beeping of horns. But to be fair, every other road user seemed to ignore this too, and Pete had an excellent time ringing his bell at everyone who beeped at us.</p>\n\n    <p>We dropped the bikes off at the rental place, retrieving my driving licence, and returned to our room for a shower. It was nice to cool down, have a tea and work on my journal for a bit, but before long, we were ready for some lunch.</p>\n\n    <p>We popped back into the village picking up a few bits and bobs to eat and replenishing our tea stash (vital). Then it was time for Lost Lunch again and a bit of a rest in our room.</p>\n\n    <p>Late afternoon found us setting out again, this time to investigate the possibility of getting a massage locally. We sweet-talked the local ATM into relinquishing some cash and then ventured to one of the beauty spas that were dotted around Tam Coc. There was near our hotel that we passed each day, and there was incredibly a lady outside who tried to sell us a massage, so this time, we let her. It was only 200000 dong - a little under £8 - for a 45 minute neck, back and shoulder massage and so we figured we’d go for it.</p>\n\n    <p>We were ushered inside, leaving our shoes out in the street on a little stand, and we began with a little foot bath of warm water and rose petals, seated on big armchairs in the window. It seemed to be one young girls who was running the whole outfit, but after a while, a couple of other women arrived and showed us upstairs where there were beds laid out ready.</p>\n\n    <p>We were taken into the same room but only had to take our tops off, lying face down on the beds. As before, the Vietnamese really do not pull their punches when it comes to massage and there were times when I thought it was possibly that I was just being beaten up, albeit slowly and methodically. The strength in their hands was seriously impressive and overall, it felt good. You know you’re getting intense pressure when the bones in your therapists hands are cracking against your muscles. Eep.</p>\n\n    <p>I also had to hold in the giggles as she answered her phone - carrying on my massage one handed - and then sent a series of texts. I could hear her phone clicking away and figured for £8, you can’t really complain. Mostly it was slightly comical. The women were also very businesslike in their manner: they saw no need for a modesty towel or anything and we were pushed and pulled about as they worked.</p>\n\n    <p>We felt loose and stretched out afterwards. And in need of some dinner! But first, there were some errands to run. We visited the tour office again to arrange a trip to a nearby pagoda for the next day, and we also asked them to book us transport to the train station in the evening. With this sorted, we returned to our bar from previous night to grab a drink, Pete opting for a beer while I tackled another frozen mango daiquiri. Delicious!</p>\n\n    <p>We perused the internet for dinner suggestions and decided to go with the Family restaurant down the road. First however, we needed to check out the action in the town square...</p>\n\n    <p>As we’d been having our drinks, facing out into the street to observe the Friday night activity, we had seen a chap drive into the square with lots of small cars on the back of his truck. We didn’t think much of this at the time, but a while later, one came barrelling out of the square, across the road and down the alley beside us. And it was driven by a young lad who couldn’t have been more than six, with an even younger boy who must have been his brother.</p>\n\n    <p>No one seemed to worry - or even notice - that two small boys had just committed mini theft auto, but we peered over to the square and found that it was in full local party mode. Heading over to investigate, we found not one, not two but THREE party buses had pulled up and were serving drinks from on-board bars and doling our karaoke to the eager crowd. A large group of women were all dancing in sync to a pop version of ‘Stand by Me’ and the tiny cars were being driven around by tiny children. They seemed to have a handle on them - one performed a three point turn in front of us, others circled the parked cars - full size - that dotted the square here and there and several of the children were driving younger siblings around. It was wildly comical - like Dodgems Without Borders - but the parents were completely blasé about the whole scenario.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272632235_5dcda8cefd_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52271173012_7e5115aa81_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Having inhaled this quite unique sight and soaked up some Friday night atmosphere, we hit up our chosen restaurant for dinner. It was pleasant and the food was hot, but it wouldn’t be my favourite place we’ve eaten as ai found the flavours a little more bland. We split some spring rolls and some fries and then I went for vegetable stir friend noodles - a bit underwhelming - with a fried egg (runny yolk, cooked to perfection) while Pete opted for banh mi. He ordered two, concerned that they might be a bit small. They weren’t but he enjoyed them anyway.</p>\n\n    <p>We were also brought a bowl of plain rice as it came free with each meal, but sadly it was a bit of a waste as it didn’t really go with either of our menu choices. We also got a large hunk of pineapple each to finish with; another addition that came free with each meal. This we did eat, but when our enthusiastic hostess tried to bring us some extra watermelon to snack on as well, I managed to make convincing enough we’d-love-some-but-we’re-just-too-full faces and gestures and averted that particular fruit-based minefield. She brought us a free bottle of water each instead, which actually was useful.</p>\n\n    <p>On our way back to our hotel, we stopped by to visit Susu and buy a bottle of water, receiving many pleased licks as we rubbed her tummy and scratched her behind the ears. Then we settled back into our room for the rest of the night, a cold shower each very much in order and the air con doing its thing.</p>\n\n    <p>And because we like to party and mix things up, we finished the night with a round of tea, an episode of Lost and an episode of Modern Family. And a slight later alarm for the next day. Score!</p>\n        \n</section>",

It was already 30 degrees, but don’t worry folks, my app informed me that the humidity made it feel like 37 degrees so the beating the heat plan was on fire.</p>\n\n    <p>Although we’d asked for breakfast at half seven, by ten to eight, it still hadn’t appeared and we went down to the ground floor to look for it. Our ride to Trang An was scheduled for 8:00am and we were going to be cutting it fine. However, I’m a master food shoveller if nothing else and so when eggs and bread appeared with 7 minutes to spare, we both were able to process this in three minutes, no messing. It was tasty, and would hopefully set us up for the morning. Our taxi pulled up right on time and we set off through Tam Coc, heading towards Trang An.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52265419517_0d234b28b7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269709624_2fba2b1bea_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Trang An is the main reason that visitors come to Ninh Binh, but apparently there are more domestic tourists than foreigners. The main draw is the landscape: an incredible collection of jutting limestone mountains that rise out of quiet, still wetlands and rice fields, dotted with caves and temples. And a UNSECO world heritage site to boot. It’s often described as Halong Bay but on land and you pay to be rowed around the waters on one of three routes from Trang An.</p>\n\n    <p>We bought our tickets at the office and then headed to the large building beyond which the boats were moored. There were all the usual tourist trappings: videos playing, shops trying to sell you things and, of course, a long queueing system. We were behind a large tour group who shuffled along in a straggling clump and even though it was only half eight, there were still quite a lot of visitors.</p>\n\n    <p>When we emerged beside the water where the boats queued to pick up passengers, we were asked which route we wanted to do. Based on a hasty glance through the leaflet, I suggested route 1, as it seemed to have the greatest number of caves. And also, maybe it’s number 1 for a reason?</p>\n\n    <p>Logic aside, we settled on one and then had to wait for another pair to join us. The boats take 4 passengers and the staff match you up to ensure that each boat is fully occupied. Before too long, a pair of women completed our party and we hopped onto boat 1080 that had pulled up at the edge of the water.</p>\n\n    <p>The two women sat in the front with Pete and I behind, all of us perched on the little wooden planks that made up the seats of the rowing boat. In the back, the boatwoman gathered her oars, set up her umbrella to shield her from the sun and we were off.</p>\n\n    <p>The route around Trang An was around 3 hours long; we had been warned by the people in the internet that there would be no shade and the sun was indeed extending its ultra hot rays in a completely transparent attempt to sizzle us. But we are not so easily sizzled (or so we like to think) and had drowned ourselves in sun cream, donning hats and sunnies in preparation.</p>\n\n    <p>The pace was extremely relaxed and leisurely which seemed ideal and I almost thought so could detect a whisper of a breeze while we were out on the water. This lasted a sold two minutes until our boatwoman handed Pete and I paddle each and indicated that we should get rowing.</p>\n\n    <p>Right. Hadn’t read about that online.</p>\n\n    <p>Equally, none of the other boats seemed to require their passengers to paddle; instead the bamboo flotilla ahead of us was a veritable forest of umbrellas as tourists fought to give themselves shade. And also, to avoid a tan: while in Hanoi, we had asked a guide why so many locals were fully swaddled head to toe as we often saw people riding motorbikes like this. Which seemed to us swelteringly hot and also extremely impractical with all that fabric. The guide had told us that is was fashionable to be pale and so lots of women in particular cover their skin as much as possible when outside.</p>\n\n    <p>Yikes. A pasty high five to me though.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, Pete and I set about rowing, and a third oar was passed up to the women on the front. If I’m completely honest, I don’t feel like our efforts made a huge amount of different. The two women alternated paddling vaguely, putting in the odd strike when they remembered in their conversation, making it challenging to row in a rhythm. Pete and I could row fairly well together but heat and humidity meant our energy was quickly spent and I can’t honestly say that we made the boat go much faster.</p>\n\n    <p>We sweated more though. Lovely.</p>\n\n    <p>I tried not to wonder whether we had to paddle because the boatwoman thought we were too fat to be rowed. On a similar boat trip in Tam Coc, the boats will either take 4 Vietnamese people or 2 foreigners because, and I quote: “Vietnamese people are smaller than foreigners”. It was a little disheartening to think that I counted as two people.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269448133_fe8a53cd0b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266666134_cc680b29a3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The landscape however was spectacular: there was something amazing about drifting between the enormous peaks, seeing the forest-like density of green carpeting their slopes, interrupted by jagged shards of rock jutting towards the sky. The insects chirruped from their leafy abodes, small diving ducks were suddenly swallowed into the waters before bobbing up unexpectedly miles away, and fish of all sizes would appear here in there, flitting by in shades of murky khaki or occasionally bright gold. The water wasn’t deep, and a thick carpet of pondlife seemed to be growing from the lake bed. One plant looked almost like coral in plant form, extending thousands of intricate branches and tendrils below the surface, waving with the current, clustered in huge groups. They looked soft and inviting, almost furry as I pulled my oar through them.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266912510_bb8af5fdf1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52265464317_8ac89314c1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As we progressed, more and more of the other boats which had set off alongside us peeled off to take either route 2 or route 3, and it was lovely to find that, for much of our trip, we were the only boat we could see on the water. My leaflet promised that “tourists who travel in traditional boats can experience the nature through different emotions that created by travelling inside different caves, discover the pure beauty of the origin of human life, reconnecting with deep spiritual space and discover oneself”.</p>\n\n    <p>That seemed like a lot to fit in so I though I’d better get cracking with some self discovery and whatnot.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269429061_8c1abbe13e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266875935_ac7f416073_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I hadn’t realised that we would make stops on the journey, but our boat woman guided the craft into the steps at the bottom of a temple site - Den Trinh. The only way to access it seemed to be across the water, the way we’d come, and she indicated to us that we should climb out and go and take a look.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a little look inside, discovering some of the same features we’d first learned about in Hanoi: the incense and offerings, the crane standing on turtles and even a white horse. It was lovely. There were quite a few people around from the cluster of boats which had drawn up to the temple, but it was also nice to stretch our legs and stand up straight after being a little bit hunched on the boat seats.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266894405_0fe39ceeac_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269459768_8396b312de_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We climbed back into our boat before too long, this time with Pete and I in the front. As we now only had one oar between us, I had more time to take photos and admire the scenery. I already thought that I preferred Trang An to Halong bay: it was somehow more peaceful and I felt closer to the landscape.</p>\n\n    <p>Although to give Halong Bay it’s due, the boat was comfier. And had a better tea set.</p>\n\n    <p>Plus they didn’t ask us to row.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52268467412_a4b1bfd478_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52265433682_db1b50b3db_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We paddled onwards and soon reached the first cave we would visit. There were nine along our route in total, and each one was a natural tunnel-like passage through the rock to which brought us out into a new spectacular lagoon, ringed with peaks and all but cut off from the world.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266404721_9b7001d71a_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The cave - Hang Toi - was much longer than I thought it would be and the craggy ceiling dipped down low enough that we had to draw in our oats and flatten ourselves into the boat. Lights illuminated the folds and sculptures that time had wrought in the limestone overhead and it was several long minutes once we’d lost sight of the opening before we reached the end of the passage. It was quite exciting!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266889150_8b6e52215c_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We passed through two more stone caves before our next stopping point, each time finding ourselves in a new secret lake dwarfed by beautiful limestone spikes. It was an almost otherworldly landscape and the still water through back beautiful reflections of the views above us, punctuated by the leafy pads and blooms of waterlilies.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52269448083_5f8b457fac_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266685814_662d7f3cff_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Stoping point number 2 was Den Tran: another temple that we clambered out of the bait to visit. At this location, we found a small stall selling fruit and ice cream and a number of benches - with backs!!! - along by the water and so we sat down, indulged in the luxury of leaning back, and guzzled some of our water as a peace offering to the sun. However, our indomitable boatwoman was gesturing to us to walk along the bank, so we got up and followed the path, finding that it led to some stairs up the mountain.</p>\n\n    <p>These were steep and alarmingly numerous and when we got to the top, sweating buckets and out of breath, we found the view mostly obscured by tree branches, and while there were a couple of small gazebos, there didn’t appear to be a temple. There was a different way back down so we followed it and found ourselves back by the water.</p>\n\n    <p>Only it was a different bit of water.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52265453312_eb4aabf353_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266912170_50bd8e2be2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>On the upside, we also found the temple: it was carved in stone and quite small but an information sign explained that it was 700 years old so fair play. A few offerings do flowers were placed inside next to burning incense and a giant bell hung to one side which Pete managed not to ring. Although it was an effort as he quite wanted to.</p>\n\n    <p>The downside was that we had to walk back up and down all the stairs again.</p>\n\n    <p>When we found our boat once more, not only was sweat dripping off my nose and chin, but it was running down my arms and legs, quite possibly leeching our the sun cream with it. We guzzled more water, resumed our seats in the back of the boat and took up the oars once more.</p>\n\n    <p>We drifted slowly on through 4 more caves, some longer, some shorter, and one which contained a large number of pots of wine, stashed on shelves in the rock to keep them cool. Spoiler: it was not really cool in the caves, but arguably it was out of the direct sunlight.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266912390_03bbab0663_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266423201_76bc9e402e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We stopped at one more temple on our tour, Khong Temple, and while there were some steps to climb, it was not nearly so many. We took in the large signs proclaiming the site’s UNESCO World Heritage status as of 2014, crossed a small stone bridge over the water and the presence of a second large bell proved too much for Pete whose self restraint broke so that he could give it a few dongs.</p>\n\n    <p>It made him happy.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266912350_d5b2cae3f0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52265453307_841603e2e3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Climbing the steps up and over a small rise, we found that this time there was no need to made a return journey as boats were able to get round and pick up their passengers. So we entered the temple for a look around. There were impressive, wooden temple gates adorned with beautiful carvings, ornate pillars painted red and gold framed the interior, offerings of beer, dragonfruit and family packs of biscuits were placed on the central table and we found some huge, blue and white ceramic urns.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete quite fancied one for our flat but reckoned it might be easier to look and see if we could get one at Ikea instead of carrying them home. My favourite urn was decorated with a pattern of intertwining dragons who twirled and prowled around the curved surface, rendered in beautiful detail.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266431221_1cfe5dc1c6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266431251_5c9f497d0a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was our favourite of the temples.</p>\n\n    <p>All that remained was to complete our circuit and head back to the start of the tour. The journey took us through two more caves, paddling carefully to avoid striking the walls, and along wide, serene water ways, dominated by vibrant, green-clad rock sculptures, proud against the intense blue sky.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266447828_4aac56a8f4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52265464087_47a2c5bb9c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>A few minutes before the end, our boatwoman pulled up to the bank and handed round feedback forms - just as I assume the boat crews have been doing down the centuries - and we passed back a tip with our form. After all, having been doing some paddling ourselves, we could appreciate how much effort was required to spend three hours guiding the boat around.</p>\n\n    <p>Back at the landing stop, we departed our little vessel, waving our goodbyes to the boatwoman and attempted to locate the exit. We spotted our driver waiting for us across the road and attempted to cross, but we were shouted at by a security guard who blew his whistle and made us troop through the long maze-like path of gift shops and so forth. Sigh. We indulged in some disgruntled muttering.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266912155_4374b097e2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266439948_3e681e9414_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We were drenched in sweat and had just about finished our water, so it was a relief to pile into the air conditioned car and head back to our hotel. It was around midday so once we were dropped off, we headed for the little shop to pick up buckets more water and some lunch supplies. We were ruminating on which flavour noodles might be the best when Susu, the dog from the night before, waddled over and we spent a lovely few minutes giving her some nice scritches and giggling as she licked our legs and feet. She seemed pleased to see us and once again came around to the counter with us to pay.</p>\n\n    <p>It was blissful to finally collapse into our air conditioned room. I checked the weather: temperature 35, feels like 45 with humidity. Obviously. But we’d had an amazing morning and while that was possibly the most I’d sweated out yet, it was nothing that a shower and a cup of tea wouldn’t fix.</p>\n\n    <p>We made our noodles and watched an episode of Lost over lunch - we used to do Lost Lunch back in peak pandemic times - splitting some more Korean flavour fake Pringles. Then I worked on my journal, Pete quietly cursed the internet speeds and I made more tea.</p>\n\n    <p>Mid-afternoon, I started to hear thunder and found the sky had clouded over, lending a somewhat gloomy aspect to the distant peaks. And late afternoon, once we decided to step out for the evening, we found it was softly raining, barely more than a drizzle, but enough to make little puddles and take the edge off the heat of the day.</p>\n\n    <p>There was loud music emanating from somewhere nearby and we wondered whether there was some sort of local event on. As it was still warm and the rain was so slight, we decided to forgo waterproofs and just wandered through the village to investigate, looking out for a spot to have a drink. Undercover.</p>\n\n    <p>It turned out the music was coming from a house a couple of doors down: an old chap was sat by himself inside with doors and windows fling wide, warbling along to karaoke which was playing on a big screen. He was clearly in his own little world having a lovely time and we chuckled to find that the party tunes had such a sweet, wholesome source.</p>\n\n    <p>We ended up in one of the many open-fronted bar-slash-restaurants that seem to line the main road which we picked at random, reasoning that it would be good to try somewhere new. It turned out to be a good pick: we ordered a frozen mango daiquiri and a passionfruit mojito to split half and half, and found the that wifi was much faster than at our hotel. So Pete pulled out the laptop and we got to work on a few blog posts as we enjoyed our cocktails.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266475338_9cf9f5ef0f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266459916_918e77debe_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The drinks were probably the best ones we’ve had yet, the mojito laden with passionfruit and the daiquiri akin to drinking mango purée. I love it when a cocktail obviously has actual fruit in it instead of flavoured nonsense and these were a cut above! Plus they were a fraction over £3 each so we couldn’t go wrong really.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266481208_0ae12e3ed0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266730994_beef89e7a3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>With two blog posts down, the sun had set and it was dark in the street behind the bar’s twinkly lights. Suddenly a high-pitched squeaky yapping rent the air. The lady who ran the restaurant then scooped a tiny puppy up from the floor who was hiding beneath a table as a couple of larger dogs walked by. He’d clearly been frightened and while the other dogs were curious rather than aggressive, the little pup made it clear that he was not up for being friends with them.</p>\n\n    <p>A large number of dogs wander about in Tam Coc - they all ignore us and are no trouble and we think they are mostly owned rather than strays. But this puppy was adorable and I went to ask the lady if I could stroke him.</p>\n\n    <p>She immediately plonked them tiny ball of floof into my arms and left me to play with him, so I brought him back to our table, gave him some nice cuddles and then let him sit with Pete.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266476268_2f8b0bfe65_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I worked on the blog while Pete and the puppy became firm friends, the little doggo licking Pete’s hand, snuffling in his pockets, curling up beside him and then finally burrowing behind Pete where he seemed to feel safe and secure as he fell asleep.</p>\n\n    <p>He was a wriggly little creature and every so often would stir himself to move around, change positions, sit with me and yawn or snuggle in for some cuddles, but we had lovely time with our new pet and his very soft ears.</p>\n\n    <p>But after another round of drinks - an even better mango daiquiri and a beer - and another blog post while the internet was running hot, it was time for us to leave. We left the little bundle of fluff asleep on the bench but somewhat regretfully as the bar we’d selected at random had had not only excellent drinks and great wifi, but the best taste in furry friends.</p>\n\n    <p>We wandered back down the road looking for dinner and decided to try the Farm restaurant which I’d read was good on Trip Adviser. We had a flip through the menu on the pavement and then, to the delight of the waitress, ventured under cover for a table.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266481328_38c3046502_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52266731119_a7b0b633b4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Again, the place was completely open, apart from an overhead cover to keep the rain off, and we placed our order. And then found a jenga set on the table and set to work attempting to topple each other. I won but barely; if the tower hadn’t collapsed after Pete’s final brick, I would have been out of options when it came to choosing my next block to remove.</p>\n\n    <p>Mid-game my portion of fries arrived and my goodness they were tasty: piping hot and crispy, crinkle but with a fluffy exterior. I dipped them happily in hot sauce and they barely lasted longer than the jenga tower.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete had a pork and pineapple stir fry with rice, I had chicken spring rolls and we enjoyed our food enormously as it was fresh and delicious. We also split a second portion of fries, because YUM. While we were eating, one of the couples from our Hanoi food tour appeared, taking a seat at the table across from us so we had a quick natter, and then another puppy appeared by our feet, clearly interested in our food. A little larger and older than the one from the first bar, the waitress said he’d suddenly appeared that day. He didn’t go for a chip but did enjoy a couple of morsels of Pete’s pork and while he did submit to a couple of little pats, as soon as he worked out the food was done, he was off. This puppy was certainly more single minded than our previous tiny friend.</p>\n\n    <p>We paid our bill and set off back to the hotel. The rain had stopped, we picked up some more water (although Susu was flopped under a chair and didn’t come out to say hello) and retreated to our room for the night.</p>\n\n    <p>I finished my journal, and had a quick shower - the evening air was still hot enough to warrant this despite the rain and the fact that sunset was long gone - and Pete made us both a cuppa. A small lizard let itself in under the door and immediately ran up the wall to hide the fan. Because as we all know, lizards love an appliance. We watched another episode of Lost and a Modern Family and then settled down to rest.</p>\n\n    <p>Because of course, there was the chance of beating the heat of the day if we set an early alarm. Just because it didn’t work the first time, didn’t mean it couldn’t work the next time!</p>\n    \n</section>",

We had some scrambled eggs cooked to order which was nice with a bit of toast and while the buffet wasn’t the best we’ve ever had, it still made a decent brekkie. And after all, when you pay £17 for the room for a night and it includes breakfast, you’ve absolutely got a bargain!</p>\n\n    <p>Back upstairs we sorted out a few bits and pieces, packing up, working on a blog post and I did a little research into our next destination.</p>\n\n    <p>Mid-morning, I felt a little restless and as Pete was happily ensconced enjoying some Commonwealth Games badminton in the air con, I decided to take myself out for one last Hanoi wander. I had one more cafe I wanted to visit and sometimes, you just have to go and get your elevensies.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264456986_acac5695c9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264726134_de468363e9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n    \n    <p>The more time I spent in Hanoi, the more I liked it: the cheerful bustle of the streets, the shops and stalls spilling onto the pavements with lots to look at, the people heading here and there, locals and tourists alike. It was humid but I was quite happy strolling along, dodging motorbikes and enjoying that feeling that comes when you’ve stayed somewhere a little while and you start to know your way around. Hanoi gets two very enthusiastic thumbs up from me.</p>\n\n    <p>I found the Little Plan Cafe down one of the narrow alleys we’d learned about on our walking tour. Sandwiched between a motorbike repair garage which seemed to mostly operate on the pavement and another shop selling bits of hardware was the entrance to the alley, and just above it, the smallest of signs, easily missable, indicated the cafe lay within.</p>\n\n    <p>I ventured forth, found another small sign indicating a door off the alley with chap leaning in the doorway smoking. He moved aside to let me in and I found myself standing in an entryway, half of which contained a minute kitchen and sink, and the other half of which was occupied by a staircase. The chap from the doorway told me to go upstairs and go through the door on my right, which I did. I was grateful for the directions as I’d never have opened it otherwise.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52272175693_b8a315be4a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264472713_f8c7ec8283_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Inside was a little secluded nook of peace, tranquility and tasteful, cohesive design. There was a lovely vintage feel about the little cafe: retro pieces had be placed artfully around the space, like old cameras and sewing machines. Prints and maps adorned the walls, ephemera decorated the empty spaces and the muted colours and cool air provided a beautifully secret contrast to the incessant activity and brashness of the city outside.</p>\n\n    <p>It was also clearly a bit of an Insta hangout and hipster haunt. There was an upper mezzanine where locals who I assumed were students worked at laptops, whereas downstairs it seemed to be more tourists. I was the only western tourist I could spot, but I think most of the rest of the customers were Asian tourists.</p>\n\n    <p>The little kitchen I’d passed downstairs was what served the cafe, and a member of staff popped in with a menu. I looked down the list, passing over banana cafe milkshake (no thanks coffee) and landed on banana cinna milkshake. Cinnamon and banana? Iced and cold? Thick and creamy? Yes please!</p>\n\n    <p>And I ordered a mug cake for food measure because they actually had mug cake on the menu. WIN! Although I did check what kind and then waitress told me it was chocolate. Always worth checking it isn’t something disappointing like watermelon or red bean. She warned me it would take a while to prepare, but I figured I had time.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264947830_e78bbbc249_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52263505212_6ac0d4039d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Then I set about snapping some pictures of the room as when you’re somewhere this photogenic and carefully curated, you may as well take the photos to prove it. I accidentally befriended two other tourists who asked me to take their photo and wanted me to pose them against what I thought was the best background. At least, I think this was the question based on the mimes and smiles we used to communicate. The one word we did all understand? Instagram. Typical.</p>\n\n    <p>Then they kindly took a picture of me and then took a photo with me before we all returned to our tables.</p>\n\n    <p>My milkshake arrived and I sat down to slurp through it, editing a few of my trip pictures. I discovered pretty quickly that banana cinnamon milkshake did in fact also have coffee in it. Sigh. It was really delicious (if you ignore the coffee) and much of that seemed to sink into the bottom so the flavour was mild enough in most of the drink that I managed to consume it. And it was indeed cold and creamy which went a long way towards satisfying my intentions in ordering it.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264469901_0492b38776_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264947835_44884620b4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was about 45 minutes before my mug cake put in an appearance but it was completely worth the wait, and I was happily watching the world go by and reading. Served in a big teacup, the cake was beautifully chocolatey, slightly gooey in the centre and had a dollop of ice cream on top. Divine.</p>\n\n    <p>The Little Plan Cafe was easily my new favourite abroad cafe that I can probably never go back to but that I will think about every so often. Dreamy sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>Eventually I had to return to the hotel and find Pete so I dropped off my payment in the little kitchen downstairs and ventured back out into the sticky warmth of Hanoi’s streets. I picked up a couple of postcards as I walked back and then met Pete in the lobby, all checked out of our room and ready to go. We had a bit of time before we needed to leave which was just long enough to pop up to circle K and grab some snacks for our afternoon’s journey.</p>\n\n    <p>I was very much 50-50 as to whether we would actually make the journey we intended to make after my misadventures with the booking the previous day. But I asked the hotel reception to get us a taxi, and she didn’t seem surprised by the address of 58A Tran Nhan Tong Street so I figured that was something.</p>\n\n    <p>It was a cheap ride to the minibus pick up point, but it turned out to be a reasonably clear location rather than the random address it appeared from our ticket. I’d hedged my bets and gone with the supplied address rather than the map coordinates, and this appeared to have been a wise move. One side of the street was given over to coach parking, so at the very least, we were at a transport hub, and the taxi driver dropped us off outside the relevant address - there was a cafe whose name was 58A, scrawled on a large sign which helped - and pulled up behind a minibus already parked there. Another good sign.</p>\n\n    <p>We were about 40 minutes early for our 2:00pm departure which sounds insane, but the ticket advised us to arrive 30-60 minutes ahead of the ticket time as the minibuses tend to just go when they feel it’s a good time, and fluctuate based on traffic and goodness know what else. And sure enough, a little before half one our minibus showed up.</p>\n\n    <p>I checked with the driver that it was the right one - I took his nonchalant drug to be a yes - and we waited to board. This was delayed somewhat by the current occupants - all tourists - who wanted to go to the old quarter, including one particularly vocal French woman who was under the impression that the ticket she’d bought would take her to the hotel. We weren’t sure whether she’d been mis-sold her ticket or misunderstood what she’d been sold, but I knew from my research that the minibus didn’t go to the old quarter, and public transport definitely doesn’t do individual hotel drop offs. I did tell her that a taxi to the old quarter was only $2 but as she said she’d paid quite a bit extra to be taken to her hotel she wasn’t going to get off the bus. Great.</p>\n\n    <p>There followed a long series of phone calls between various parties as the driver didn’t speak English and none of us spoke Vietnamese but after twenty minutes or so, it seemed someone sorted her out a taxi and she left the minibus and climbed triumphantly into the waiting car.</p>\n\n    <p>We settled into our seats ready for our journey, and I was glad we had indeed been early as the minibus set off several minutes before it’s allotted time. We were amused to find that the seats had inbuilt massagers - what kind of bus was this??? - and then slightly taken aback with the degree to which the seat pummelled your back. It was a bit next level and so I switched it off.</p>\n\n    <p>I was feeling quite relieved that the whole transport scenario had worked out so well, right up until the point where the driver pulled into a car park and made us get off the bus. We were barely ten minutes into our journey so I wasn’t sure what the stop was for, but we didn’t seem to have much choice in the matter and so off we hopped.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately, another minibus appeared and after saying Ninh Binh repeatedly to the driver and receiving some more vague smiles, we piled on our bags and got on.</p>\n\n    <p>This one had more passengers but fewer facilities. Which is a fancy way of saying no massage chairs. I’d come to expect this as standard now, as of ten minutes previously, so clearly we were going to have to slum it in normal chairs.</p>\n\n    <p>I dozed for the most of the journey; the minibus had blowers but didn’t really seem to be doing much in the way of air con and the warm air made me feel drowsy. But true to form, the minibus pulled up outside the minibus office In Ninh Binh a little before half three and we had made it. We double checked with the driver as the office seemed to be in a nondescript suburb (and no one else got off which seemed odd) but he pulled our bags out of the back of the van which seemed to be a reasonably solid indication that our time in his bus was over.</p>\n\n    <p>I stepped into the office and found a woman behind a desk, so I mimed ordering a taxi and she kindly obliged. The taxi driver duly appeared and had me put our location straight into Google maps in his phone which conveniently got around any communication and directional challenges - well done that man. He dropped us off outside our hotel in the neighbouring village of Tam Coc and we staggered inside under the weight of our bags and the oppressive heat of the sun.</p>\n\n    <p>The place was deserted. They were definitely expecting us as the hotel had messaged only that morning to say they were ready for us to check in. But we roamed over 4 floors of the building to no avail.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete eventually found someone asleep in room on the fourth floor and managed to persuade them to come downstairs and check us in. By this point, we’d clambered up and down the stairs quite a lot - it was an outside metal staircase up the back of the building with the rooms coming off long terraces. We were shown up to the third floor and pointed towards a room with a key in the door before the lady left, shutting the door behind her. No check in, no passports, no payment.</p>\n\n    <p>Not to worry: the room was clean and a good size and we switched the air con on as we both felt quite hot and bothered. Mostly though, I was thankful we’d arrived!</p>\n\n    <p>We managed to get another blog post live and enjoyed a shower each to de-sticky, and then Pete got the kettle on to make a nice cooling hot cup of tea because that’s how that works. We were running low on teabags and creamer so I made a mental note to track down tea and, if possible, milk in the village.</p>\n\n    <p>After a while, a different lady passed our window, spotted us and knocked on the door and we had a slightly awkward half English, half mime conversation about what we wanted for breakfast and when. We hadn’t firmed up our plans but we were hoping to do our sightseeing earlyish the next morning, partly to avoid the hottest part of the day but also to beat the bus loads of tourists arriving from Hanoi on day trips. So we opted for a half seven breakfast, hoped that made sense and figured we’d just have to see what appeared in the morning. I think pineapple was involved.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264490938_c76bcc200e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264490953_5441edeb2a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once it was dark, we set out to see a little bit more of Tam Coc. It was surprisingly touristy in a backpacker way: cheap and cheerful with twinkly lights, music, a good number of bars and restaurants back to back along the main road and very easily accessible. Probably the easiest place to get around yet.</p>\n\n    <p>Our first aim was to find a way to get to Trang An the next day so we could do the classic Ninh Binh boat tour. We stopped in the doorway of a tourist booking office with promising signs in the window and two lads were inside tucking into some dinner. When we asked if we could go to Trang An tomorrow, one of them assured us that we absolutely could: we could just go there whenever we liked.</p>\n\n    <p>Yes of course, we agreed. But how were we to get there and back.</p>\n\n    <p>He recommended we just drive on motorbikes or possibly bicycles and enjoy being outside instead of in a car, missing everything. He gave us a map and said his Mum would probably give us much more detail, but she wasn’t in.</p>\n\n    <p>We thanked him and left. Being in possession of neither bike nor motorbike - or motorbike licence for that matter - we were perfectly happy to go by car. And while hiring bikes was something we quite wanted to do, right that second wasn’t the ideal time to do it.</p>\n\n    <p>We had much more success at the second tourist office, and within minutes had arranged for a driver to take us to Trang An and collect us again afterwards, leaving at eight the next morning. Sorted! It was relatively inexpensive and convenient and feeling pretty positive regarding our trip booking achievements, we went in search of drinks and dinner.</p>\n\n    <p>We opted to eat at T-Pub which I’d seen recommended online. It had lots of lounger-type chairs scattered around an outdoor area underneath rows of multi-coloured strung lights, and it seemed to be doing a steady trade. We found a spot to sit looking out at the road and ordered some drinks, and we were quite happy to relax and watch the world go by: tourists on bikes, locals pulling a cart up and down with a dog riding up front and the usual sprinkling of motorbikes and cars honking at anyone and anything for no real reason. The traffic was comparatively quiet though when compared to Hanoi and shops and business festooned with lights made the street seems vibrant and inviting.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete sank a beer and a frozen strawberry daiquiri, I had an Oreo milkshake and a giant bottle of water from the little shop across the road. Most of the T-Pub clients seemed to be bobbing backwards and forwards to the little shop to pick up their water supplies.</p>\n\n    <p>We ordered dinner as well and although it took a long while to come, we weren’t in a hurry and were more than happy chilling for the evening while we waited.</p>\n\n    <p>I say chilling: it was of course well over thirty degrees and my phone informed me that the humidity factor made it feel like 37. So perhaps substitute the word “chilling” for the phrase “heatslumping”. That’ll do it.</p>\n\n    <p>Once it arrived, we tucked into our dinner with gusto. We had ordered a falafel burger each which came filled with salad and roasted pumpkin which was a surprising but welcome addition. The falafel was crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, there was hot sauce on the table to add a kick and the fries which accompanied it were homemade, chunky and satisfying.</p>\n\n    <p>As the night wore on, we settled our bill and popped to the shop across the road for more water. We also managed to score milk and teabags, and Pete made a firm friend in the chubby little shop dog whose name was Susu. Susu was practically grinning with pleasure as Pete scratched her head and chest and the shop owner chuckled. Susu gave us some little licks of thanks and came with us when we went to the counter to pay, leaning on my legs and licking my toes. She was very sweet, and so was her owner. Quite the sales team really.</p>\n\n    <p>Back in our room, it was absolutely air con o’clock and I had another shower to rid myself of the sweat and bug spray combo. Then I worked on my journal for a bit before we settled down for our nightly rendition of Lost. With a cup of tea.</p>\n\n    <p>We aren’t animals.</p>\n\n    <p>It was nice to settle down for the night in the knowledge that we had a new area to explore the next day. Here’s to adventure dreams!</p>\n\n</section>",

Actually, it wasn’t dark, and even though our room was chill with air con and gloomy from the heavy curtains, once we opened them, it was light, and stepping out onto the balcony revealed a warm and muggy morning, if somewhat grey with cloud cover.</p>\n\n    <p>We got dressed and headed upstairs for breakfast, billed as a light affair before our morning’s activity. First breakfast, if you will.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262258271_0aae405d99_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52261283282_97298e4984_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We had a pastry each and a round of tea. And a second round of tea. Pete popped back to our room while I finished off my second, and when I returned, I found him curled up back under the covers, guarding the bed. He’s such a good guard-husband.</p>\n\n    <p>We got ready to kayak and when the announcement pinged over the intercom, we were ready to go and find ourselves a boat.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262258171_14dba93ff1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262258081_61c14a4e64_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We hopped into the kayaks straight off the back of the ship and pretty much had free reign to paddle about and explore. Despite the thick cloud, it was still warm and humid, but it was nice not to be in the direct sun and we paddled about quite happily.</p>\n\n    <p>We investigated a small nearby shore at the base of one of the rocky structures and then kayaked around the ship in both directions. It was nice to see it from the outside. We could see what we thought was a little fishing boat across the water, but we didn’t go too close in case it was a snack boat and we’d were hounded into buying beer and Oreos. You have to be careful when out on the high seas.</p>\n\n    <p>Paddling up close to another limestone outcrop, we were investigating the worn base where it protruded from the water. It seemed to be covered in barnacles and sharp, sticky-out protrusions and as we got closer, it started to move. It turns out there were loads of tiny grey crabs scuttling around, getting on with all their sideways business and snacking on whatever it is that crabs snack on. We could see little flashes of purple pincers.</p>\n\n    <p>We paddled a little further on - when we got into it, we could get up a pretty good speed - and then started to feel a few drops of water. Deciding to quit while we were ahead, we slid our kayak in to dock back on the ship and climbed aboard, keen for a shower as the oars had splashed lots of water over us.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete jumped into the shower first while I hid balloons under his pillow and in his bag, and then I showered. When I came out, Pete was once again guarding the bed, oblivious to the extra balloons he was lying on, and before long he was asleep. Which is presumably how he does his best guarding.</p>\n\n    <p>It has never been clear to me exactly what Pete is guarding the bed from, but he seems to feel there is a very real and present danger as he had to guard the bed a lot.</p>\n\n    <p>I read for a little while, watching the peaks of Halong bay retreat through the window as the boat started its return journey. And by nine, we had packed up all our things and were ready to check out of our room.</p>\n\n    <p>We settled our bill, giving ourselves points for honesty as we pointed out we hadn’t been charged for a coke and fruit juice we’d had the night before. And then we got double honesty points when we were given 100 000 dong in change instead of 10 000.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262462511_9781d81462_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262722054_509fe84480_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We wandered upstairs a little early for brunch but people seemed to be already seated and tea was out so we ventured in and took our seats. It was a lovely spread and I enjoyed a freshly cooked vegetable omlette with a crusty roll, some very tasty fried noodles and then my usual cake and fruit platter. There are reports that my cake got topped up as it was the tasty fruity one from lunch the day before. Omnomnom.</p>\n\n    <p>Three teas down and feeling pretty full, we moved to lounge and read until it was time to depart. The little tenders took us back to the mainland, waving a path through the beautiful peaks and rocks as we absorbed our final moments in Halong Bay.</p>\n\n    <p>Disembarking was all very efficient: we unloaded ourselves, found our bags, and our transfer back to Hanoi was already waiting for us outside. We had a smooth journey back to the city, alternating between snoozing and audiobook listening. And also sometimes falling into the intersection of the that particular Venn diagram which meant I had to rewind my book to the last point where I was conscious.</p>\n\n    <p>We were staying in a different hotel this time - a bit of shame as we loved our previous Hanoi haunt, but it had jumped in price for this night and so we’d booked a cheaper alternative.</p>\n\n    <p>It didn’t have nice teaware.</p>\n\n    <p>Having said that, it was again a perfectly nice place with a spacious room and air con and we opted to chill out for a little while, catch up with ourselves and sort out some admin for our journey the next day. I had a lovely old time on arguing with the internet; I downloaded a bus ticket for the transport we’d arranged the next day, and the address we’d be given was not in the same place as the Google maps coordinates. So where were we meant to go? In the end, I assumed that worst case scenario is that we’d go to the bus company’s office which was between the two points and ask them. Not ideal, but manageable.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, not even the worst case scenario which I suppose would be never finding the pick up and missing it entirely.</p>\n\n    <p>Or being eaten by a basking shark or something. That would be way worse.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52261490122_e2c058c1ec_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262734209_d7f3241085_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n\n    <p>Public transport woes aside, we had a nice evening ahead planned and so at half five, we upped and outed to go and visit the last sight that I’d really wanted to see in Hanoi: train street!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262946505_e0cd0d300b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264289878_6e810961a8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I’d seen pictures of train street and I guess in many ways, it kind of does what it says on the tin: there‘s a street and every so often the trains go down it. However, street is an optimistic word for narrow alley, and the alley in question is lined with little shops and bars so you can wander the tracks and grab a drink and then should a train come through, everyone just has to get out of the way and businesses reel in any chairs and tables that might be in the train’s path.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262734234_59dbdc734e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264297413_4be8a9466a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n\n    <p>When we arrived, there were of course quite a lot of other tourists there, but we could see why: it really was quite charming with the open fronted small businesses, lanterns strung over the balconies, locals perched on the rails and lots of people sat out enjoying a coffee or beer. We picked our way along the sleepers, skipping over stones and watching all the people. There was such an uplifting atmosphere and while I appreciate that tourism has massively transformed what was previously a small residential snicket into a bustling hotspot, it did seem to be upbeat and thriving.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264544609_79c0fc1d14_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264289858_352df5f8c8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We reached the point where the tracks reached the road and then turned back to wander up the rails again: I would have loved to have spent an afternoon people watching and waiting for a train to go by.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52263310492_69998e8bdc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264767960_af1b694fe8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>However, we had to depart as it was time to search for food. We’d decided to go back to Banh Mi 25 as we’d really enjoyed their sandwiches on our food tour, and it didn’t hurt that it was nearish to our hotel, cheap, and had a menu we could work out. Plus it was DELICIOUS so there’s that.</p>\n\n    <p>We found a spare table and claimed it, taking in the local artwork peppering the walls; I enjoyed the vintage-style Tiger Balm adverts in particular. There were pot plants, the shop front was completely open to the night air, and the infamous conical Vietnamese hats had been repurposed into light shades with little felt decorations hanging from them.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52263317802_086404d6c6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52264297313_9e6043a193_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I ordered a chicken and avocado banh mi, and Pete opted for the traditional pork with pate. And it’s course we both had them with everything: cucumber, chilli, carrot, coriander and mint. They were super delicious, the baguette having a lovely crisp outer and fluffy middle and a dash of hot sauce just bringing all the lovely, vibrant flavours together, cut through the the fresh zing of coriander.</p>\n\n    <p>I’m a coriFANder.</p>\n\n    <p>The sandwiches were actually made at a little stall on one side of the street, while the two seating areas inside different shop fronts were situated on the opposite side of the street. Meaning that the staff had to dodge and weave between motorbikes and general street traffic to deliver the food. It was quite comical to watch.</p>\n\n    <p>We devoured our meal quite rapidly. In fact, they were so delicious, Pete had a second banh mi, opting to try the chicken and cheese. He let me try and it did indeed have many top yummies inside. I asked Pete how the traditional pork and pate lined up against the chicken and he reckoned in the final tally, the type of meat didn’t make much difference as the real flavour comes from the extras. Which was interesting; I’d expected him to say the pork was better. Pete’s other comment was that the bread plays a starring roll, especially for the texture and I absolutely agreed: that fresh baguette vibe is all-important.</p>\n\n    <p>We settled out bill - 3 sandwiches and 2 drinks for less than £7 - and headed back for our hotel, going via circle K for supplies. I had been hoping for another chocolate fish ice cream but they only had red bean filled ones which I just didn’t fancy. But we got some milk for real tea and some biscuits so it was a pretty solid effort.</p>\n",

Again. We breakfasted on eggs, bread, fruit and a cuppa and then returned to our room to collect our things and do a final sweep for anything we might have missed.</p>\n\n    <p>We hauled our bags downstairs, settled our bill and found our ride ready and waiting, a minute or two early, which is nice but did mean we had to scramble. At the appointed time of 8:20, we were already seated in the back of the minibus rumbling through the streets! We would miss the hotel though: it had been an excellent base with lovely staff, a super convenient location and, of course, top teaware. Who knows what mugs or teacups we might be forced to partake of in the future?</p>\n\n    <p>When the minibus had collected it’s last passengers we began the drive out of the city towards Halong Bay. There were 8 of us on board: 3 retirement age couples and then me and Pete. The minibus was comfortable though and after a little natter with the other tourists, we passed the journey quite happily with iPad shows for Pete and audiobooks for me. We had a brief stop at some services and then continued onwards and eventually the curious limestone shapes that are synonymous with Halong Bay appeared on the horizon.</p>\n\n    <p>I wasn’t sure initially if they were where we were heading as they seemed to rise out of the land, but as we got closer and the minibus started to negotiate the labyrinthine docklands roads and passages, it became clear that they were indeed out to sea.</p>\n\n    <p>The minibus pulled up outside a little cabin for us to wait in until it was time to board our boat at noon. When the moment came, a small tender pulled up to the pontoon and we shrugged into lifejackets and squashed into the little benches. We had assumed that we would just be going a few metres to the ship moored nearby, but we were mistaken, instead heading out towards the rearing limestone monuments in the sea.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete joked that this was our entire cruise ship and I figured if that was the case we would need a refund. We pondered the idea of passing snacks down from the front of the boat, taking turns to nap on the little benches above giggling over the idea of the poop deck.</p>\n\n    <p>Blame Pete, he went there.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258702066_2efe5e2dcd_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>But when we coasted between two mountains erupting from the ocean, we emerged into a bay where another series of ships were moored, and were soon clambering aboard our boat.</p>\n\n    <p>Time to cruise! We were shown to the boat’s sitting room and given a nice chilled glass of passionfruit juice to enjoy while we waited to check in. It was lovely to see views of Halong Bay out through the huge picture windows. A baby grand sat in the corner with a little sign on top that said “only for competent players”.</p>\n\n    <p>A chap went for a bit of a tinker. He clearly had not read the sign and would have struggled to even see competent with binoculars. Everyone clapped when he’d done though as clearly everyone is nicer than I am.</p>\n\n    <p>We were introduced to the key staff on board and talked through the schedule; we had barely 24 hours on board so it was good to know that we could make the most of them. Then it was time to collect our keys and find our room.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258716783_331e4e1c3d_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I chuckled when I stepped inside and found that they’d really gone to town on the bed. Pete, coming into the room behind me, commented that I laughed the laugh of someone who’s just seen a decorated bed.</p>\n\n    <p>Whenever possible, I had informed places that we were staying that we were on our honeymoon, just in case that smoothed the path to an upgrade or a cheeky freebie. On the boat, not only had they folder the towels to look like swans, not only had they scattered rose petals to kingdom come, but they had also laid out heart-shaped balloons. It was admittedly quite comical and we enjoyed it.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257733877_f9352ed191_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258982844_1072193e38_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our room was lovely: surprisingly large with a great bathroom and a bath with a view, plus our own balcony where we could sit and watch the beautiful landscape slide by.</p>\n\n    <p>At half one, we went up to the dining room to sample the lunch buffet, and tucked into some salad, soup and rolls. There was also an enormous quantity of seafood but I was happy to stick to something a little lighter. We sat in the window, watching the craggy limestone sculptures, moulded by time and the elements, vegetation clinging on wherever it could and the blue sky above reflecting in the sea below.</p>\n\n    <p>For dessert there were two kinds of cake (although one turned out to be coffee which threw me as it looked like chocolate) and a big vat of something I thought was a berry compote. I almost ladled some over my cake but decided not to at the last minute. Which was wise as it turned out not to be berries, but red sticky rice. I ate it but it was a bit weird.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258702091_d802a725ec_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52259187760_5ec20cdc06_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>After lunch, we had a little wander around the boat, taking in the top deck, baking in the sun, and the pool on the lower deck, looking out to the bay. It was once again incredibly warm, and so after we’d explored fully, we decided to go and sit on our balcony and watch the views drift past while we we shaded from the sun and the light breeze was pleasant. It was peaceful and relaxing, just a wonderful way to enjoy and embrace the environment.</p>\n\n    <p>Until the air was split by a loud guttering engine. Our initial confusion regarding the source of the noise soon turned to surprise as we found a small wooden boat with an ancient, rattling motor pull up alongside our ship. The boat was guided along by a woman who was attempting to sell her wares to guests on board, and her boat was absolutely crammed full with food and drink of all description. While she had a selection of local fruit and so on that might be expected produce, she also had bottles of wine, cases of beer, Oreos, instant noodles, crisps and pretty much any other snack you could imagine.</p>\n\n    <p>I was torn as on the one hand, our peaceful oasis was shattered by the impertinent engine and the persistent shouts of the woman trying to sell us things. But equally, I guess she was just trying to make a living.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258982794_2d08fda421_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258733201_c9241d2189_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We retreated indoors for a bit to enjoy some air con and to escape the unrelenting sales pitch, and then we returned to our balcony. I made a pot of tea as, in true Vietnam style, the teaware was top notch, with cups, saucers and a pot all wrought in a pale jade-green ceramic. And so we had a brew amidst the excellent scenery of Halong Bay.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258748338_144261a71f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52259218120_224018a223_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The boat manager announced over the intercom that it was time to get ready for our trip excursion, so we donned hats, suncream and sunnies and went to hop back on the tender.</p>\n\n    <p>We departed promptly and then had to circle back to pick up some guests who had literally missed the boat. And then we were off to visit the Bright and Dark caves.</p>\n\n    <p>This involved being dropped off at a floating pontoon and transferring to wooden boats. These fit around 6 to 8 passengers and were rowed by a a local standing on the back with long, slender oars that reached down to the water. It was quite an impressive feat and while the little vessels wobbled and twisted as we arranged ourselves along the little benches, we were soon slipping through the water towards the cave.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262189378_b911eb66ea_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257765147_b5bdec6302_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was wonderful to be able to see the limestone rocks up close and they jutted like infant mountains out of the sea.

It was actually more of a short passage through the rock, but weird and wonderful craggy shapes hung in rocky curtains from the ceiling and bags fluttered and roosted in the cracks and crevices. Water dripped from above and it was gloomy but before long, we were emerging from the end of the passage into what presumably is the bright cave.</p>\n\n    <p>Unfortunately, Pete’s sunglasses made a bid for freedom overboard which was frustrating.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262176816_ce851f1f86_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262176816_ce851f1f86_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The bright cave isn’t a cave at all: it’s a section of sea that is completely concealed and cut off from the rest of the sea, ringed with limestone protrusions and accessed only by our passageway in and one or two much smaller tunnels through the rocks. Our rower allowed the boat to simply drift in this secret lagoon so we could take in the surroundings. The vault of the sky gleamed blue above us, little waves gently rocked the boat and we drank in the view. It was marvellous.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262660915_fb395ff8a9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52261203582_325843a654_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Eventually, it was time to leave and so we were paddled back through the tunnel as the bats flew and skittered and returned to the pontoon, the sun dipping and weaving in amongst the peaks.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262463503_41bbacb3e7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52259278402_b19b58b007_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Back on the boat we got changed, I pulled the balloons all out from my side of the bed where Pete had hidden them, presumably hoping I wouldn’t spot the giant, mysterious lump under the cover, and we went for tea and cookies up on deck.

Sadly the chips were pretty much gone, but there were prawn crackers so I munched a few as I circled the deck snapping pictures. We decided to treat ourselves to cocktail each, and so we ordered a mojito and and mai tai and retreated to the upper deck to take in the sunset.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262458444_99f3e247b2_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As the sun relinquished it’s fiery grasp on the day, it was cool enough to sit out quite comfortably, and a little bit of a breeze helped to stir the air. Lots of boats were mooring up around us, their lights dancing and twinkling in the water, and we sipped our drinks and watched the yellow in the sky fade out to pale blue and then inky darkness. Beneath the surface of the sea, we spied a huge jellyfish undulating past and debated the merits of swimming the next day.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262485484_75eac55996_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52261213747_40091664ff_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>At half seven, it was time for dinner and so we popped to our room to freshen up, I pulled balloons out of the bed again and we headed to the dining room. We were served a set menu with a surprisingly large number of courses. There was an appetiser of pickled prawn (fine but didn’t love) and squid cakes (yummy) followed by a seafood soup that was strangely gloopy. The flavour was fine, just mildly savoury, but we were intrigued as to how the texture had turned out so slimy.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262698510_d834bc2a59_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Then we had some steamed seabass with red rice and mushrooms, and then Pete had a steak while I opted for chicken, served with mashed potatoes, veg and some sauce.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52261269127_4f9e3f992c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52259278172_1019943131_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Pete read out the menu to see what was for dessert. “Flan. That’s not a good starting word. I feel like nothing good begins with flan.”</p>\n\n    <p>I had to agree. However, before we could explore the flan plan further, the manager of the ship asked us all to applaud the staff for servicing the meal which we did, and then said that there was another reason to be celebrating too.</p>\n\n    <p>At which point, she announced that Pete and I were con our honeymoon and had us wave to the room at large. Then the lights were turned off and we were given a giant cake with candles to blow out, and a bunch of flowers. Yikes!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262741485_e13d934a2d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52261283542_f4cfba529f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We asked the staff to cut the cake and share it round with everyone and in the mean time, we attacked our flan which was served with watermelon (because flan and watermelon deserve each other) and tapioca balls. I ate mine but Pete refused.</p>\n\n    <p>The cake on the other hand was excellent: soft sponge, piles of buttercream and chocolate icing. YUM!</p>\n\n    <p>Feeling pretty full, we went back to our room for the night. We had an early start the next morning so we showered, made a pot of tea and settled down in bed to watch an episode of Lost. Rearranging my pillows part way through, I found that they made a funny squeaking noise. As Pete was shaking with silent laughter I pulled even more balloons out from under my pillow. Pete was quite upset that they hadn’t popped when I’d leaned on them.</p>\n\n    <p>I was going to need to work out my counter attack.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262727040_4532c384fc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52261269137_3694ebf851_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>With our alarms set for six and the boat moored up for the night, we settled down for a good sleep at eleven so that we’d be ready to make the most of our last morning in Halong Bay.</p>\n\n</section>",

We knew the hotel did a decent spread and we helped ourselves to eggs and little bread buns alongside plenty of fresh fruit. Pete’s stomach was still playing up a little and while it wasn’t causing him pain particularly, he was trying to eat a little more carefully and stick to plain things.</p>\n\n    <p>I dropped off our laundry at reception - they offered a very cheap same day service that we were keen to take advantage of - and found our guide for the morning already waiting for us.</p>\n\n    <p>We had booked a free city walking tour as we’ve found that these have been really excellent for getting to know new places in the past, especially when you have a local to share their insights and give you a bit of history. While there isn’t an official charge, the guides are paid in tips and we’ve always had incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgeable leaders in the past.</p>\n\n    <p>This was a bit different as it was just the two of us and the guide came to meet us at the hotel. This had initially surprised us, but it was nice to know we could go at our own pace, ask questions, take photos and rest if we needed to.</p>\n\n    <p>Our guide told us that his nickname was Sunday - the fun day as it’s everyone’s day off - and he beamed at us constantly. He was a mine of information and clearly had a lot of love for the city, keen to ensure that our experience was positive. He explained our intended route and then we stepped out in the warm city streets.</p>\n\n    <p>First of all, Sunday wanted to make sure we could cross the roads safely. After our experiences in Indonesia, Hanoi was proving pretty straightforward, but he advised us that we should walk slowly and confidently across the street, waving our hands down at the traffic. This lets the drivers know you’re crossing and to go round you. The important part is not to panic and run as it becomes much more challenging for the drivers to predict your path and avoid you. They aren’t going to stop so you kind of just have to be confident and deliberate in your intentions.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258077769_940576b219_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257814843_5bce2c0d4b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our first port of call was the White Horse temple. We chatted on our walk through the streets, practising crossing the roads and flapping at traffic. I wondered if it might just be a good idea to constantly flap my arms while I walked as we’d often be in the road, pavements being crowded with parked bikes and food stalls.</p>\n\n    <p>I refrained however. I think it would have embarrassed Pete.</p>\n\n    <p>The temple dates back to the 9th Century although it’s purpose had shifted in that time. The white horse refers to a myth that Sunday relayed to us, that the the then king had apparently spotted. The temple was really beautiful; Sunday leant my a shirt to just lay over my shoulders, but we could go inside without paying and see the intricate carvings and the extravagant and flamboyant offerings and displays.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258020661_18b22e2031_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258304934_a87e061718_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>There was a big Chinese influence in the the architecture and some of the wooden pillars were decorated with carved characters which apparently these days, the majority of people don’t read since Vietnam switched to the Latin alphabet. To enter the temple you had to step over quite a large barrier in the door, designed to keep out snakes and floods. A higher barricade further in was to prevent women entering, their clothes meaning they couldn’t manage the step over, but that custom us apparently outdated now.</p>\n\n    <p>Yay.</p>\n\n    <p>In the inner sanctum, we saw the statute of the white horse, lots of statues of cranes standing on turtles symbolising the way they work together to each benefit the other, and lots of offerings to the gods. This includes the burning of incense and fancy decorations, but also everyday things like cans of coke and beer. The Vietnamese acknowledge the gods used to be people and therefore still enjoy and appreciate the things that mere mortals do. Which is quite nice actually.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258020876_7dc181018c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258038413_1e278d2cae_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>One of my favourite bits was a beautiful carving of a dragon. Sunday told us that this represents a legend telling of the way land animals came to be. All the fish were told that if they could complete a series of challenges, they would become dragons and live on the land. They had to try and swim up a waterfall and eventually all the fish gave up.</p>\n\n    <p>All except the carp who tried over and over again, a thousand times, showing great resilience and eventually making it, becoming a dragon. Top work that carp. This story is often used to inspire students to succeed in their studies.</p>\n\n    <p>Although Sunday also told us that the incentive, especially for boys, it’s pretty high. If you do well enough in your exams at age 18 you can go to college and avoid military service. Although it seems you can also avoid the service by paying “coffee money” to the right people.</p>\n\n    <p>I googled this later and it seems that “coffee money” is a disarmingly cute name for bribery payments in Vietnam. These can be big payments used to secure land in the cities or prestigious public positions, or small payments which it seems many families offer to their children’s teachers. The average rate in Hanoi is apparently $30 a term.</p>\n\n    <p>Which leads me to believe I am owed quite a lot in bribes now in my 12 years of teaching.</p>\n\n    <p>I think I would prefer tea money though.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258326509_54806d17c6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258305159_9036d297fd_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Meanwhile, back on the tour: we left the temple and Sunday led us down what he called a narrow alley. And he wasn’t kidding: just about wide enough for two people to pass, these passages were long and dark but surprisingly hide prime real estate as it’s thought to be very lucrative if you live in Hanoi’s Old Quarter.</p>\n\n    <p>In the past, 60 to 100 people would have lived in small rooms off the alleys, sharing a kitchen and bathroom. Now however, wealth is increasing and families have their own facilities and we passed security cameras and air conditioning units which looked almost out of places in the dark little passages.</p>\n\n    <p>We also learned the reason for the length of the passages: in times past, buildings were taxed based solely on their width. So of course as the city was constructed, properties favoured very narrow street fronts but when back a long way to give enough space. Hence the intricate network of long passages which cross cross the area.</p>\n\n    <p>We emerged from the alley and passed the last remaining city gate - defended so valiantly by Vietnamese soldiers that the French decided to leave it standing when they took over. Apparently guards at the other gates surrendered quickly and the gates were destroyed. Then we turned into a street lined with market sellers: we had reached the outdoor market.</p>\n\n    <p>Sunday told us that all the stalls were illegal and that none of the sellers paid rent or had licences to be there. However, if you pay coffee money to the shops, you can set up in the road in front of one and this the sellers had down in abundance. There was lots of produce and meal, spilling in every direction and motorbikes squeezed up and down, parking up briefly to choose their wares before loading them onto the bikes and moving on to the next stall.</p>\n\n    <p>Apparently the police don’t come down the road very often (coffee money again) and on the rare occasion they do, they’ll call ahead to warn the market sellers who simply pack up their things and wait for them to pass before laying everything out again.</p>\n\n    <p>It was fascinating to see, but Sunday told us that markets like this are in decline. He told us that he and his generation preferred to used shops like Winmart and Circle K where you are guaranteed a certain standard of produce and a fixed price. I was surprised to hear this as I would have assumed the loss of the markets would have been a bad thing, but Sunday said he hoped that in 20 years or so, they’d be gone entirely.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, he was very keen for us to shop at Winmart and mentioned it several times.</p>\n\n    <p>From the outdoor market, we went to the official indoor market, constructed by the French over 100 years ago and split into two sections. Once we’d passed the guy carving up a very recently deceased turtle in the entrance, we in amongst the seafood stalls. We also passed stalls selling dried fruits, seeds, herbs and spices, dried mushrooms and various other foodstuffs.</p>\n\n    <p>The second hall contained the “dry goods” which meant clothes and shoes, hats and underwear and lots of homeware stalls too. There were wholesale stalls upstairs, but we had a bit of a wander around the ground floor to see things for ourselves and the amount of stock was kind of insane. You could pretty much buy anything.</p>\n\n    <p>Leaving the markets behind, we strolled back through the Hanoi streets towards the lake. On our way, we passed several stalls selling paper facsimiles of loads of items and Sunday told us that these to burn so that your ancestors could use them in the afterlife.</p>\n\n    <p>He told us that actually most people in Vietnam aren’t religious, but that people do pray to their ancestors, usually twice each lunar month. Shrines are made in homes and the things that are burned then pass to the late ancestors to enjoy. This can be anything from paper models of houses and cars to clothes, iPhones and iPads.</p>\n\n    <p>Sunday told us he didn’t believe in this. He grinned and said he couldn’t understand the point of burning an iPhone but not a charger. It would be useless to the dead without one!</p>\n\n    <p>We arrived at the lake we’d walked around on our last evening in Hanoi, and as it was a Sunday, there were more people about that ever. Additionally, the roads were all shut for the weekend and the area becomes pedestrianised which made things nice and easy for us. Fewer hands to flap.</p>\n\n    <p>However, before we hit the lake, Sunday took us down another little alley, up a hidden flight of stone steps and into a first floor coffee shop. This was apparently the place where the famous Vietnamese egg coffee originated and while I confessed to Sunday that I don’t like coffee, I was happy to give this a try in the name of research. I kind of think you have to when you’re abroad!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258532125_1db8f04cc8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258326474_22c68f932a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The room was littered with low tables and tiny wooden stools - the sort that make your knees bend up to your chin. We decided to share an egg coffee - while I’m happy to taste one, I didn’t think I’d be jazzed enough to sing a whole coffee - and Sunday ordered one for us.</p>\n\n    <p>So what’s egg coffee? Well, it wasn’t at all what I thought, but I’m not quite sure what I expected, short of seeing an egg yolk bobbing in the top perhaps. An egg coffee is apparently a bit like egg nog - there’s coffee in there, egg, some condense mills and a bunch of honey to sweeten it. When it arrived, there was a beautiful design swirled on top and the coffee looked thick and creamy, not unlike a cappuccino. In fact, that’s what the coffee’s creator had been attempting to emulate, but without milk which was expensive and difficult to get hold of back in the day. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be commonplace now.</p>\n\n    <p>Taste-wise, it was actually pretty good if you ignored the bitter coffee taste. In fact, if an egg hot chocolate was a thing, I would happily have slurped one up. But we finished it between us, and the thick, foamy liquid was pretty satisfying. It was good to have sampled such a Vietnamese staple.</p>\n\n    <p>While we drank our coffee, Sunday gave us a sticker with his details of and a little gift each of some balm that apparently soothes mosquito bites and prevents seasickness. More than happy to give that a go.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258240441_382a193920_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our tour finished with a stroll along the lake down the side of the French corner, stopping at the massive Russian monstrosity that jarred with the more elegant buildings around it in an attempt to instil communism.</p>\n\n    <p>Then it was time to head back to our hotel. We’d had a great morning, learned a lot about the city and been lucky in our guide. We waved goodbye outside our hotel, tipping generously, and then headed indoors for a bit of a air con and a cuppa.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258729860_dd8e2ba74a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258244786_bedca16528_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We chilled for a while, worked on a couple of blog posts, had more tea and I started on my day’s journal. Then I popped out mid-afternoon to go and visit a little coffee shop called The Note Cafe.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257276287_4ec241dbc8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258733655_b9789978f5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I will confess up-front that I had seen this place on Instagram and that even if Pete had been in the best of health, I feel like he would have declined to join me.

The premise is simple: the whole cafe is absolutely plastered in sticky notes with little handwritten messages that previous visitors have left.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258251646_216909716e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258527324_39bc72cc91_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>A chap waiting in the doorway walked me up two flights of narrow stairs to a seat at the bench in the window and I ordered a cookie crumble Frappuccino (which I checked did not contain coffee!) and took my seat. It had a cracking view down between trees over the lake, the road below was quiet as traffic had been banished for the weekend and as there was no glass in the windows, a very slight but welcome breeze disturbed the heavy air. I amused myself reading the notes stuck to the bench in front of me and pondering what to write on my own. The messages from other guests varied: some were heartfelt, sweet and sincere, some moronic and others were clever. I chuckled at one which quoted a favourite TV show (I’m not going to say, you’ll have to look at the pictures and work it out because if you know, you know and I salute you and if not then it isn’t going to be funny anyway). I also found notes from other honeymooners which was cute.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258251836_7dede53d87_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258740675_9a5b8e28bf_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>In the end, I settled on leaving a note for Emily as she seemed the most likely to swing by this way in future, and I wrote a bit more of my journal and read some more notes while I slurped my drink.</p>\n\n    <p>Which by the way was incredible: like a big ice creamy milkshake with lots of crushed cookies. YUM! I actually think Pete would have enjoyed the cafe after all.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258251816_6d7253524f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258740800_d577834f75_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>With my drink finished, I set our back into the sunshine, topping up our cash reserves at a handy ATM and even making a trip to circle K to collect some more water and buy Pete a coke, as I thought he might enjoy one.</p>\n\n    <p>Back at the hotel, I found Pete happily ensconced watching his laptop and I made another brew to see me through to our next outing.</p>\n\n    <p>We prepped one last blog post and then threw a few things in a bag ready to head out for the evening. Food tour time!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258256701_cf3368f880_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258746340_be45a5ae3b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The meeting point for the food tour was less than five minutes from our hotel. I had an address (not especially helpful to us usually as we can’t usually find street names or numbers), a name and usefully, a picture of the place we were looking for sent by our guide, Hanh.</p>\n\n    <p>It was the picture that helped us identify the location in the end. Not because the shop looked like the picture - it didn’t as it’s sign was gone and they’d moved things around in the front - but because the picture showed a small slice of the next door shop which did look like it’s picture. Phew!</p>\n\n    <p>Hanh emerged from inside and shepherded us through to the back. The shop had a women cooking over a stove in the very front and the rest of the space was a long cut narrow room with plastic tables and tiny stools for perching on. It was busy with tables being turned around quickly and Hanh perched us at a table, got us both a drink and some dipping sauce, and went back to the street to scout for more tourists.</p>\n\n    <p>We were a group of 8 in the end, and it was lovely to meet some other travellers, partly to be able to swap stories and chat, but also because it took the pressure off with the food; we didn’t want to feel watched while we ate!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258555804_4ba55f9bab_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258273726_e108f6248b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>In the first place, we sampled Banh Xeo. These are like crispy pancake shells folded around beansprouts and possibly other unidentified fillings. However, what surprised us was that this isn’t eaten directly: instead, you wrap it in a sheet of rice paper along with some green leaves and herbs, dip the whole thing in the sauce and eat that.</p>\n\n    <p>Well, we had somewhat limited success with this as the rice paper was a bit brittle and snapped around the pancake rather than rolling. While we had a good go, we ended up finding that we were better off just munching on the pancake, especially as the rice paper didn’t seem to add much flavour.</p>\n\n    <p>It was a good dish to try though and new to us, although we did have to dock a few points for the cockroach that ran over Pete’s foot. Win some, lose some.</p>\n\n    <p>We moved off for the next stop on our tour: it turned out to be the Banh Mi place that Sunday had recommended to us that morning. I love it when a plan comes together!</p>\n\n    <p>We all huddled around a table in the shop - this one was a little bigger and more cafe-like, but the food was made and delivered from a stall across the road. It was also clearly more geared for tourists as there was a menu with information in English. Which was handy as we were given the option to pick whatever banh mi we fancied and I would never have known to pick Banh mi Thit Ga & Bo qua thai lat otherwise.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262722454_375e14a58f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257304292_e056984626_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Banh mi is a hybrid dish developed by the Vietnamese with French influences. It’s a sandwich made in a baguette traditionally with pork, pate, pickled veg and various sauces but other varieties exist too. The sandwiches are chunky and sizeable so Hanh suggested we share one between two. As I’m not the biggest lover of pate, Pete agreed to split a honey roast chicken and avocado banh me with me instead and we placed our order, along with some fruit juice, and waited with anticipation.</p>\n\n    <p>Our fellow tour members were a friendly bunch: there were three other couples (two from London and one from Oregon) and it was lovely to hear about others’ travel plans. Even though we’d only been in Vietnam for 4 days, the other seemed to be right at the very beginning of their trips and we were all excited to get a bit of insight into authentic Vietnamese cuisine.</p>\n\n    <p>The banh mi arrived and it was wonderful! Crisp baguette with a fluffy inside, tasty veg which added a bit of crunch, and we sampled the various sauces on the table which claimed to be hot but were rather just pleasantly piquant. The banh mi quickly shot to the top of our yummy list and we very much intended to sample more on our trip.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52262451941_aa382315c5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257310027_bae8a9854b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The next stop on our trip was to try Bun cha - a dish of chargrilled pork belly and rice noodles that I had read about but never tasted before. Hanh took us to a place that initially seemed to be a few plastic seats out on the street - all occupied by hungry diners - and instead turned out to sprawl over four floors of the building. At least, we climbed 4 floors to find a set of unoccupied plastic tables and stools.</p>\n\n    <p>We were given a beer each and the food started to appear rapidly. Bun cha is served in a bowl of broth: you get chargrilled pork belly but also some more meatball-style pork wrapped in leaves. The broth is clear-ish and has green papaya in it, and into this you dump rice noodles from your plate alongside a squeeze of lemon, some garlic and some chilli.</p>\n\n    <p>I will admit that this wasn’t our favourite dish, not because it was bad, but just because it wasn’t to our taste. The broth was surprisingly sweet and I prefer more punchy flavours with spice. Im also not someone who loves to eat meat, so while the smokey, charred flavour of the pork was good, it wasn’t enough to make the dish for me. That being said, it was nice to try a Vietnamese classic in a proper local spot and I’m glad that we had the experience.</p>\n\n    <p>As we ate, Hanh kept up a cheerful patter, sharing tidbits of information about life and food in Vietnam and, specifically, in Hanoi. She marshalled us impressively, making sure we all got seated, could navigate the kamikaze traffic and got to try lots of dishes without being beset by enthusiastic hawkers.</p>\n\n    <p>Our next stop was a more unusual one and, as Hanh told us, was not for everyone. It was duck egg.</p>\n\n    <p>Except not like a tasty egg ready to eat. Not, it was one of those where it’s almost ready to hatch and instead of a nice white and yolk inside, you have a duck embryo, fully formed but soft and unborn. You could see it’s feet.</p>\n\n    <p>We opted out. Baby duck = baby yuck.</p>\n\n    <p>3 of the group did try. It looked quite grim but apparently just tasted of egg with a slightly meaty flavour, and of the ginger broth it was served in. We were almost convinced enough try except not.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately after that, we moved onto a slightly less controversial foodstuff. If a slightly more controversial premises in that we were set to partake at one of the illegal street joints where plastic chairs and tables are scattered into the road and lightweight and easy to remove if needed.</p>\n\n    <p>Although I guess if you’ve paid your coffee money, you’re OK.</p>\n\n    <p>The dish we were there to try was called Banh Cuon - and it was banging. My second favourite after the banh mi. Banh cuon are apparently breakfast snacks: chopped pork and mushroom is wrapped in rice paper, the little rolls are then steamed until the rice wrap looks gelatinous, white, wobbly and unappealing (bear with me) and then topped with crispy onions and herbs. Served with a dipping sauce.</p>\n\n    <p>I forgot to take a picture because once I’d tasted it, I just wolfed it down. But not worry as it wasn’t the prettiest dish anyway. However, it was super tasty, warm and savoury with a lovely crisp from the onions and a bit of tang from the sauce. We had two each but it’s possible I had one of Pete’s as well. Rumours abound.</p>\n\n    <p>The stall we were patronising also sold pho, and whole we weren’t there to sample that particular dish, the ladies brought out a bowl of the broth the pho is served from. They were keen for us to try it as it’s simmered for roughly 15 hours to imbue the dish with its famous flavour. It was indeed delicious and much more to my taste than the bun cha: rich and savoury and with a greater depth of flavour.</p>\n\n    <p>We also split a French brewed beer using a German recipe with a Vietnamese twist because when doesn’t that sound like a winning combination. Pete was unimpressed. It was cold though and as we were feeling hot and sticky after being out in the unrelenting humidity of the night air, cold gets you some brownie points.</p>\n\n    <p>We had two more stops left to cover on the tour: our savoury morsels (and giant face-sized bowls) were consumed and so we set about trying some sweetie treaties.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258767200_876cdcf57c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258562044_822c35b014_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our next stop was an ice cream place: WINNING! Hanh told us the shop was very popular in summer as it was so hot locals would often seek out the chilled desserts. I didn’t blame them! This was another illegal set up and my tiny plastic stool was so far into the road that if a car tried to make its way down the crowded narrow passage, I had a to stand up, gather up my seat and move to the side until it had passed.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately this only happened twice.</p>\n\n    <p>Hanh ordered 4 different desserts for us to try: first there was a bowl of mixed fruit with ice cream and shaved ice. I liked this mostly as the dragonfruit and mango were tasty and refreshing. Shaved ice always seems a bit flavourless to me, but soft serve vanilla swirled on top was good. Then there was a bowl of pandan sticky rice with ice cream and dried mango. This was called kem xoi and actually turned out to be my favourite. I really love the flavour of pandan - it’s basically cake flavour - and the sticky, glutinous texture of the rice was a good foil for the soft ice cream and the crispy hit of the dried mango.</p>\n\n    <p>The third dessert was durian and jackfruit serviced floating in coconut milk with chunks of jelly. It wasn’t the prettiest desert you’d ever seen but so hadn’t tried durian before so it was a good opportunity to eat some. Overall, I would say I felt ambivalent towards it: it was fine, but I wouldn’t seek it out. And given that it’s most famous for its truly disgusting smell, I didn’t think that was going to be an issue. Although I couldn’t really smell anything bad in the dish we were eating. The jackfruit was better: I’d only had it in a savoury context before as it’s often used as a meat substitute, but it worked well as sweet.</p>\n\n    <p>This was the dessert plonked at our end of the table while the other two had disappeared towards the others. After a while, I felt a bit disenchanted with our bowl of milk with fruit bits floating in it, and was more than happy to trade for the delights of the kem xoi. Yum!</p>\n\n    <p>The final dessert that appeared was like an Oreo sundae: lots of shaved ice was topped with ice cream, tapioca balls, Oreo biscuits and Oreo crumbs. It was tasty but we didn’t manage to finish it between us.</p>\n\n    <p>For our final stop of the tour, we wandered into the weekend car-free zone of Hanoi at the north end of the lake and found the city in full party mode. People flocked the streets, kids played with light up toys, there was music and dancing, lights flooded the lake and Hanoi was full on letting loose. It was amazing to think that the city does this every weekend as the atmosphere felt like something you might get a summer festival or maybe bonfire night with the food stalls and light-up gadgets.</p>\n\n    <p>We ended up in the exact same egg coffee spot that Sunday had taken us to that morning; clearly this was the place to go. So we creaked up the hidden staircase and found ourselves seated on some little stools while Hanh explained egg coffee to the rest of the group and they looked as confused as I had felt that morning, wondering what egg coffee would be.</p>\n\n    <p>Given that our earlier egg experience had involved premature baby ducklings, I think people felt a little bit wary. And yes, I thought about putting “eggsperience” then but I decided that this journal is too sophisticated for such nonsense.</p>\n\n    <p>Hanh said that she thought we might find the coffee quite strong and that we wouldn’t sleep if we drank it (seemed doubtful to us, but fine). However, she said if we liked, we could swap the coffee for hot chocolate.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258295538_9f274443b5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258295488_1f984184bc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Egg cocoa??? Now you’re talking! That absolutely seemed like my kind of drink.</p>\n\n    <p>So I did just that and it was magic! Incredibly thick, foamy and creamy, full of chocolate richness and happiness. I wondered if I could learn how to make egg chocolate when we returned home as I would be more than happy to consume one from time to time. Lush! It was more like a dessert than anything and I had to spoon the foam from my cup. Which I did gleefully.</p>\n\n    <p>And that was the end of the tour! Our little group said goodbye, thanked Hanh and we dispersed into the night, emerging from the little coffee shop into the thriving square to begin our walk back to the hotel.</p>\n\n    <p>We were back in our room at around half nine and we were very much in need of yet another shower to wash off the sweat from the sticky night air, and the bug spray. I had acquired some shiny new bites so I gave Sunday’s balm a whirl, and then we made tea and watched our nightly episode of Lost.</p>\n\n    <p>Somehow time had drifted on to midnight so we packed away our nice clean washing ready for the next day and settled down for the night. It was time to move on again and after we’d packed quite a bit into the day, we were ready to slumber.</p>\n\n</section>",

I suppose in many ways not that different from most of the breakfasts we’d had, but I’m a sucker for a good DIY yoghurt set up and loved making up a bowl loaded with peach, passionfruit, muesli and some sort of cinnamon nutty spread (think biscoff but not). In fact, I went back for seconds of that as it was so delectable - even the yoghurt alone was super smooth and creamy with an almost vanilla tang.</p>\n\n    <p>I also sampled the fried noodles, a spring roll and some of the breakfast cakes: there was a delicious banana bread affair and I scone where I initially thought they’d absolutely gone nuts with the raisins until I bit into it and discovered they were chocolate chips. Oops! Slathered in pineapple jam though, you can’t really go wrong.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52254107649_3089f71499_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253823386_eb8a0eacac_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We sauntered back to our room for the last time, packed up our bags and donned our swimwear. While we had to check out of our bungalow at eleven, we weren’t departing the lodge until 2:30. Definitely time for a swim in the infinity pool. Swimfinity. And some last minute photo taking. Sapa is too beautiful not to and the clouds were reflecting in the water and it was pretty much peak honeymoon stuff.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258056998_95c0b975df_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253823411_726c936913_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was hotter than the day before - ouch - and even just walking the little paths around the hills to reception to drop off our keys made us sweat. We were therefore pretty thankful to finally slide into the pool. The water was far from cold but it was more refreshing than the sticky air!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52254107744_926a98b4e7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257789551_c7889c0835_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Clouds billowed above the mountains, wreathing the views in haze and reflecting back into the water of the pool.

Pete’s stomach had been feeling a bit delicate for the past couple of days - the unremitting heat definitely didn’t help, making everything feel quite energy sapping - and so he had some vegetable rice as a bland option, while I went for some falafel bites and some vegetable spring rolls. These were cold ones with strips of raw carrot, cucumber, purple cabbage and rice noodles, wrapped in a thin rice casing. They were light, refreshing and summery and it never hurts to get in a bit of veg.</p>\n\n    <p>Plus they brought some more of that amazing pesto so winning. I was going to really miss the pesto. And the mountain views and whatever, but really: the pesto.</p>\n\n    <p>It’s the besto.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251305981_fd207743b9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257794991_ffb19a35e7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>After lunch, we set off up to reception to meet our minibus back to Hanoi. Even this short wake up the hill made us sweat again and we had taken to using the big umbrellas the lodge provided as parasols. We had gradually started to appreciate why the staff used them all the time.</p>\n\n    <p>I changed into my leggings for the journey in anticipation of the chill blast of air con and we piled into the minibus. We were one seat short so I sat up front next to the driver which on the one hand meant I didn’t get one of the comfy spacious seats but did mean that I got a great view out the front of the bus as we descended from the lofty heights of the mountains.</p>\n\n    <p>The journey was quite long and ultimately just a bit boring. I often sleep on long journeys but for some reason on this one, I felt wide awake. So I finished my audiobook, started another one, we had a stop after two and a half hours or so, and then finally we started approaching Hanoi. It was getting gradually darker and once we headed into the city outskirts, rain started to fall and I could see lightning flashing across the sky.</p>\n\n    <p>We were dropped back at our hotel around 7:45. It had stopped raining and it was a bit of a relief to get out of the bus and stretch our legs. The hotel staff were just as friendly and attentive as before and we were given a lime flavoured drink each and told that our room had been upgraded; a favour we graciously accepted.</p>\n\n    <p>We are also prepared to graciously accept mansions, yachts and piles of gold, just in case anyone is keeping count.</p>\n\n    <p>We dropped our bags in our room and we (I) were excited to see that the same lovely teaware was still present for evening cuppa purposes. We checked our map and found a branch of Circle K was only a couple of streets away and so we dived into the dark streets of Hanoi.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258762060_47b3d98116_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251807885_0310a2a7e4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n\n    <p>It was busy and there were lots of people about but we scurried past the stalls and restaurants, evading bikes and pedestrians and soon made it to the little shop. We picked up some noodles, milk (hurrah!), water and a couple of snacks. I bought a packet of “Cosy Wonderfulls” which are possibly the best named biscuits I have ever come across. They claim to be cashew and butter flavour which sounds promising, but not as promising as the name “Cosy Wonderfulls”.</p>\n\n    <p>Back in our room I had a nice hot shower and we settled in for the night. It had been a quietish day but a longish one and as Pete wasn’t feeling 100% we figured an early one wouldn’t do us any harm. So we made up our noodles and watched an episode of Lost with a cup of tea.</p>\n\n    <p>And in my case, some Cosy Wonderfulls.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52257814833_67bb630883_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251590824_43a83afb3e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>I know you’re all dying to know, so here’s the verdict: Cosy Wonderfull is a round biscuit akin to a shortbread, on the thin side and crisp rather than crumbly or chewy. Possessed of a definite snap. On the top are a few pieces of chopped cashew but not enough to create a properly cashew-based flavour. They dunk well. So overall, they biscuits are quite nice but the name is the best thing about them.</p>\n\n    <p>They don’t compete with my favourite Indonesian biscuits, but as Pete pointed out, it’s probably not fair to expect Vietnamese stockists to keep in a stash of my Indonesian snack favourites.</p>\n\n    <p>The whole experience however was worth it for the chance to say - and write - Cosy Wonderfulls extremely regularly.</p>\n\n    <p>At this point, I assume it’s clear to everyone that I’m ekeing out content for the sake of it so perhaps I’d better call it a night. We had had a busy time planned for the next day and so turn in early for a good night’s sleep was the wise decision.</p>\n\n    <p>After just one more cup of tea with a Cosy Wonderfull.</p>\n\n    <p>It’s just too fun to say!</p>\n</section>",

We also had an orange juice each and Pete put away a cappuccino while I tackled a quite exceptional hot chocolate.</p>\n\n    <p>We had no idea how anyone was meant to eat it all and while we did our best, I think we barely managed half of what was in there.</p>\n\n    <p>The glass of champagne to finish off was a bit of a treat however.</p>\n\n    <p>I made us a tea each in the room and we used a little of the milk we’d been given for the cereal. The only slight issue being that Pete has mistaken it for yoghurt and dumped some peaches in syrup into it. But who doesn’t want tea with peach milk?</p>\n\n    <p>The cloud was low obscuring they mountains but we could still see down into the valley below as we got ready for a hike, suncreamed up and swung on our day packs. Then we walked over the hill to reception for eight thirty to meet our trekking group for the day.</p>\n\n    <p>It was sweltering in the sticky air and after a huge breakfast, I don’t think either of us felt 100% jazzed for a day of walking. But that’s what we’d come to the mountains for and so hiking it was going to be.</p>\n\n    <p>We met our guide and it turned out we were the only ones foolish enough to venture out on an expedition. She explained to us that we would drive to a local village about 45 minutes away and pick up the trail from there, hiking about 7km in total and having a BBQ lunch half way.</p>\n\n    <p>And off we went! Actually, the drive helped: we got to see amazing mountain views, it was cooler in the van than outside and, crucially, we had time to digest our breakfast! As we drove, our guide told us a little bit about the different ethnic groups who live in the region; there are 5 main ones including the Hmong and the Dao and there are also lots of cultures within these groups, such as the Black Hmong who have roots in Laos, and the Red Dao. The lodge employs most of its staff from local groups so that it operates in partnership with the people and their way of life, and our guide told us lots about her daily life and experiences too.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252787626_bb3e74b0e7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253074194_d7c73b4430_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The mountain roads threw up wonderful vistas over rice terraces and up to soaring, cloud-topped peaks, but they were also tricky to navigate. Bumpy and single-lane, it was often a challenge to squeeze past when we met other vehicles. At one point we came head to head with a truck and the drivers all got out (including a van behind us) to have a very serious and important discussion about how to proceed. They managed it in the end but it might have been the narrowest gap between passing vehicles I’ve ever seen. We applauded our driver!</p>\n\n    <p>We arrived in a small village and started our trek through mountain passages. The heat was immense and we were soon sweating through our clothes and sun cream as we toiled uphill. Yikes! We also acquired two local hangers on: two women who trailed us for at least half of our hike in a vain attempt to sell us things. They peppered me with questions as we walked and it was a little strange.</p>\n\n    <p>After a while the path flattened out and we could admire the wonderful views down into the valley as the river snaked on through. We often had to jump to one side to let motorbikes pass and cows and little calves regularly clogged the way, ambling off slowly when given a bit of encouragement from our guide.</p>\n\n    <p>She showed us lots of different local plants: yellow ginger which smelled amazing, one that was super poisonous to everyone, people and livestock, with the exception of goats, and one that we could chew which had a sour, citrus-like flavour.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253103504_c3e7ef2c3c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253319945_a989e836da_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>After about 3km, we reached a small riverside hut and had a short break - even though we’d walked for barely and hour we were totally grateful for the sit down as the heat was energy sapping. It had been 29 degrees when we left the lodge at half eight, so we could only imagine what the temperature had reached as the sun got stronger and burned through the clouds.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252807298_976e37e109_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252807268_ff825a7514_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We had a little further to go up to a nearby waterfall. Standing in front of the spray was lovely and cooling and we enjoyed being next to the water on the shade.</p>\n\n    <p>The rest of our route was back the way we’d come. We chatted with our guide and she was equally curious about us: how long had we been married, how old were we, why didn’t we have children and so on. She told us she had married very old (at 21) as she had wanted to learn languages and get a job first. She had two children - she showed us their pictures - and it was also interesting to swap stories of how we’d managed the pandemic. It seems the stay at home order had been very similar in the Sapa region and she had had to keep her small children at home.</p>\n\n    <p>She told us a lot about her culture but we didn’t quite follow it all: there were various rituals involving buffalo, rice wine and kidnapping and whether families will join together depending on if the woman wants to get married. She also showed us a leaf you could blow into to make a squeaky noise to show someone you’re attracted to them. Pete couldn’t get a sound out of his but I managed a few squeaks. Not quite the virtual tune our guide could manage, but a sound at least.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete blamed his leaf. Until I made it squeak.</p>\n\n    <p>Not to worry, it’s nice to know I have marriage options in Vietnam, but I figured I’d stick with Pete for the time being.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252808328_80e4356e8b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251816962_25c52c568d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n\n    <p>We arrived back at the river hut and our guide took us down to the river. A group of men were hard at work moving supplies around as recently, lots of pools were being built beside the water for salmon farms. Apparently this is a relatively new industry but popular and lucrative.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253075194_ec1cdc69a1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252788806_6c16ce2ee0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>There was an extremely dilapidated foot bridge over the river that our guide insisted we test out, so I took one for the team and venture out a few steps for a quick photo before returning to safety.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252788756_28ac4f2e94_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252788746_0102daa3c8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We stepped up through the rice terraces towards the hut, hopping over stepping stones to avoid the water pools through which the rice grew. The crop was a couple of weeks off harvest and we could see the slightly yellowing grains waving from the tops of the stalks. The leaves were such a luscious green and the rows of rice looked so beautiful in their orderly progression up the slope.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253319780_e2114fa8d4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252816761_e01993a0ff_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We could smell lunch being prepared as soon as we arrived at the hut and we were sent upstairs where we could sit on the little balcony that overlooked the river. Before long, enormous plates of barbecue appeared and once again, we found ourselves wondering how much of the feast we’d actually be able to get through.</p>\n\n    <p>This question quickly became more relevant when yet another plate appeared to accompany our meal. And so we tucked in: there was sausage, beef and fish, long chunks of cucumber and apple, chargrilled courgette, aubergine and mushroom and to go with all this, we had some sweet chilli sauce and an amazing thick, dark, dipping sauce. We had no idea what it was but it tasted amazing on everything. (Except the apple: I didn’t dip the apple into it). We also had some crush peanuts which we could dip into after the sauce and they added a lovely nutty crunch to each mouthful.</p>\n\n    <p>One of our favourite things one the plate was the sticky rice. It sounds daft as I suppose this was the accompaniment rather than the meal, but it had been cooked inside tubes of bamboo and so had a appearance a bit like polystyrene packing chips. But it held its shape perfectly, was ideal for hoovering up the dipping sauce and peanuts and consequently was fabulously tasty.</p>\n\n    <p>I did enjoy the moment when Pete tried a chunk of an unknown vegetable and made a face: he wasn’t sold. I tried it and identified it as mushroom - big solid, almost meaty pieces of mushroom - which made sense because, as Pete pointed out: he doesn’t like mushrooms.</p>\n\n    <p>The feast of course defeated us and we hoped that the men who had been working the river could perhaps enjoy the rest. We thanked the cook and set off to walk back the way we’d come to the village. It was hotter than ever and we sweated buckets as the sun reached its zenith. We passed even more cows munching the greens along the side of the path and played guess the age of the tiny calf: Pete was way off with a month, I was bang on with 2 days. #knowyourcows</p>\n\n    <p>The tiny ones were super cute and spindly though.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251846817_d4a5feae32_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We made it back to the village much more quickly than the journey out, but we didn’t really pause and there was more downhill for which we were thankful after toiling upwards on our way out. To end out walk, our guide took us for a break at the Riverside Lodge: the budget sister hotel to ours situated in the village itself.</p>\n\n    <p>We walked through the village and we could see lots of locals in their brightly coloured, red head scarves which looked cheerful and festive. Children waved and called hello, chickens scratched around looking for tasty morsels and people were hard at work, laying out corn and herbs to dry in the sun. Our guide told us that different crops are grown at different times in the year: when the rice is done, corn can grow, and lots of different herbs and plants are harvested from the jungle which costs the upper slopes of the mountains above the rice terraces. Lots of the locals are farmers and families often pitch in together to work the land and gather the various crops in different seasons.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252816836_481e5e66f1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253319940_967a5ff915_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once we reached the lodge, crossing a somewhat sturdier footbridge, we were more than happy to plonk down in the airy dining room and order a fruit juice. Decorated in similar style to our hotel, the design was minimal but beautiful, the room was open to the river where small children played and swam and it was blissful to be in some shade with a cold drink and rest.</p>\n\n    <p>We passed the time quite happily until the van came back to pick us up and so we wandered back through the village with another couple of guests who were hitching a ride and made the journey back up the snaking mountain roads to our lodge.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253352590_e4fe5904c5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252870458_67c510c0f8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We were extremely happy to dive into a cool shower back in our room and Pete made us a round of tea. Minus the peach milk this time, but I almost think the morning tea was better with the fruity milk rather than the creamer powder which just isn’t the same. The brew was very welcome however and we lounged quite happily enjoying the drink while I got to work on my journal.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251862422_75cd7d9dc2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258257548_dc69d86839_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>When 5:00pm rolled around we stepped out of our bungalow and made our way to the spa: massage time! We were having an hour’s treatment each and when we’d skirted the hilltop and entered the spa, I was immediately put into the unique spa-zone feeling that places like that have. The air was scented, everyone smiles and speaks very softly, we were given a chilled drink and tinkly music played while the insects provided a live nature track in the background. Blissful.</p>\n\n    <p>We both chose the same treatment - an ayerverdic massage - and we were given 4 scented oils to choose from. I went with lavender while Pete chose chamomile. Then we were shown to our treatment room by the therapist.</p>\n\n    <p>The two tables were draped in soft towels and were set up facing a huge picture window looking out of the misty mountaintops which was incredible. We put on the comedy disposable pants and lay down fully ready to start relaxing forthwith.</p>\n\n    <p>The massages were amazing - out therapists didn’t pull their punches so to speak and I actually think my arms got longer. They kneaded our muscles in our legs, arms, back and shoulders, finishing with an intense face and scalp massage. I felt loose-limbed and boneless afterwards; we’d both enjoyed it and Pete felt that for once he’s actually been able to get the firm pressure he really likes.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253335520_5f825b32ee_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252849836_d6ff85bc99_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We decided to ignore the advice about not washing off the oil for a couple of hours, and instead went for a shower and swim in the pools. Quite a few people were enjoying the view and taking pictures in the upper pool so we headed down to the lower one which was empty. It was lovely to just chill in the water and paddle about as the sky deepened to a slightly darker shade of dusk. The insects were performing a cracking dusk chorus and yet not a single one disturbed the water of the pool. We were stumped as to how they keep the pools big free.</p>\n\n    <p>After our swim, we wandered back through the terraces to our bungalow for a shower before dinner. I was actually starting to get a bit peckish and so I was jazzed to find housekeeping had been and left us a banana leaf which read “sweet dreams” and a wooden box containing a little square of cake each.</p>\n\n    <p>We think it was maybe banana, but it had a very squidgy, dense texture that was more brownie-like than cake like. Whatever it was it was yummy and I thought I could get used to nightly cake being brought to me. I mentioned this to Pete in case he was eager to do this for me every day, but he wasn’t keen. Shame.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252832666_43438f2480_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We popped over to the Stilt restaurant for dinner around eight, spotting a little frog en route, and once again sitting upstairs under the thatch and high beams. We selected a variety of little dishes off the tapas-style menu and found the food to be exceptional. We shared some prawn crackers and were brought some bread with the amazing pesto-style sauce again, and then I opted for roasted cashews and some crispy mushroom spring rolls while Pete went for pumpkin soup and crispy pork spring rolls. We also got some falafel each and it was all superb: fresh, hot, great textures, amazing flavours and with dips and sauces that just enhanced the whole experience. Truly delicious!</p>\n\n    <p>So much so that we also picked a dessert each. I had a chocolate concoction which did look a bit of a splodge on the plate but tasted fab, and Pete had frozen white chocolate cheesecake. This came in a jar which he was miffed about as I’m given to understand that it was tricky to prise out, but nonetheless we enjoyed our meal enormously and I was already looking forward to our next meal with anticipation.</p>\n\n    <p>We stepped out into the dark night and wandered slowly back to our bungalow. Flashes of light flickered across the sky every so often and we wondered what they were: lights? Flash photography? But then a rumble of thunder sounded distinctly and we realised we were looking at far-off lightning bouncing off the clouds. It was quite something. There was no rain to speak of and evening was warm with a faint breeze which made it hard to imagine thunderstorms taking hold.</p>\n\n    <p>Back in our room we pretty much just flopped. We were full, hiking in the heat of the day had worn us out and the massages had caused our muscles to surrender. Basically, we just needed tea and Lost in bed.</p>\n\n    <p>Actually, there was something really immersive about watching lost in Sapa: cocooned in our mosquito net den and with the insect orchestra tuning up outside as a counterpoint to the thunder, it felt like exactly the right environment to allow us to dive into a mystery island adventure.</p>\n\n    <p>Once Lost and tea were finished we settled in to read a little bit, unwinding after a full day in the mountains and slowly drifting towards sleep. Sapa really was a magical place and I found myself wishing it wasn’t our last night at the lodge. However, I knew there would be more adventures to come and more locations on the horizon and with that thought, I snuggled down under the blanket to enjoy a comfortable night.</p>\n\n    <p>knowyourcows</p>\n</section>",

I had slept a little fitfully, my brain waking me up every so often in anticipation of my alarm, and I dreamed of sleeping through it and missing our wake up call.</p>\n\n    <p>However, our alarms did go off and we got up, dressed and packed and were out of our room in approximately 9 minutes. While our lift wasn’t arriving until half past, we had to check out of the hotel and pay for our stay, and scarf down some breakfast.</p>\n\n    <p>The hotel had kindly to offered to open breakfast a bit early for us at 6:15 and it turned out we weren’t the only guests with an early pick up as several people scurried to partake. We munched down some eggs, bread rolls and fruit - including passionfruit, hurrah! - and finished just in time to be collected by the minibus. Win(ibus)!</p>\n\n    <p>The seats in the bus were large and comfy, we were given a banana and a cereal bar each and then we set off. We picked up 5 more travellers around Hanoi and then departed the city to make the journey to Sapa.</p>\n\n    <p>According to a brief video presentation, this was a journey of around 5 hours, most of which would be on a highway which headed northwest to China - Sapa is in fact only 50km or so away from the Chinese border. And so we had a bit of a doze, listened to music, podcasts and audiobooks and generally let the world go by. We made a stop to break the journey and were entertained by a small puppy gambolling around and generally having a lovely time playing, and then it was back on the bus for the end of the journey.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251416323_d8a40972c2_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The last hour was up, up, up into the mountains; the sky clouded over and we really climbed. The mountains were green, often cut into steep rice terraces and streams wound their way through the bottoms of the valleys. We passed the occasional dam and an awful lot of large cows meandering the roads, sluggish in the heat. As the valley floor dropped away further and further, clouds started to wreath the tops of the peaks and haze meant that the mountains marched away blurring into the distance. And still we climbed.</p>\n\n    <p>Until finally we arrived at our destination: Topas Eco Lodge: a paradise in the mountains.</p>\n\n    <p>We were met at reception with a cold drink and a cold flannel (which my sleepy brain initially took to be a giant muffin as it was chocolate brown and coiled up into a bun). We ran through the things we had booked as part of our package and then we were escorted to our room.</p>\n\n    <p>The lodge is situated across two peaks; even though we were high up, plenty of other mountaintops reached for the heavens around us in every direction, stacked one atop the either until they were indistinguishable from the mist and cloud. We had both thought that it might be cooler at altitude but we were wrong with a vengeance: it was fiercely hot.</p>\n\n    <p>Must be because we were closer to the sun #physicsinnit</p>\n\n    <p>We followed the concierge along a series of winding stone paths between rice terraces and she pointed out the spa, the pools, the restaurant and reminded us to keep our room door close in case we wanted to share with lots of bugs. And actually we could hear them chirruping and chirping all around, hidden among the lush greenery. A couple of chicken stumbled across the path, we spied exotic birds too and we walked through the lodge vegetable garden and past the solar panels.</p>\n\n    <p>Our room was a little stone bungalow which was beautifully appointed with a comfy bed, chairs, tea making facilities (yay!) and best of all, a balcony with insane views across the peaks. We’d also been given a bottle of fizz for our honeymoon. Whoop!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52250362772_945e2e2121_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251835335_006f42afd9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once we were settled and sorted, it was almost one and we decided to hit the restaurant in search of a light bite before hitting the pool. The restaurant - named the Stilt house - was a lovely wooden building and we sat upstairs under the thatched beams in the quiet cool. A quick skim down the menu landed us both immediately on the same dish: falafel banh mi. Genius: we ordered 2 and after a quick debate, decided not to order anything else.</p>\n\n    <p>Which was a wise decision: despite the menu recommending 2-3 dishes per person, the banh was enormous. It was also FABULOUS.</p>\n\n    <p>A large soft baguette had been jam packed full of falafel and salad, topped with sauces and coriander and there were chips on the side as well. We reckoned double cooked at least from the combination of fluffy and crunchy.</p>\n\n    <p>I traded my tomato for Pete’s coriander because marriage means that you can, we we both attempted to get our faces around these extreme sandwiches. Challenging but worth the attempt many times over and even more enhanced by the garlicky, pesto-like herb paste that we’d been given.</p>\n\n    <p>I had a fresh juice with orange, mango, carrot and turmeric to wash it all down which was very refreshing and while we were pretty stuffed, lunch boded well for the remaining meals in the lodge.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251400281_4262426c71_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Time for a swim and so we gathered our things and hit the pool.</p>\n\n    <p>And by pool I mean: infinity pool!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251400221_64fe78cd3a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258039661_d88012dd86_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n    \n    <p>It was stunning: the water seemed to stretch across to the very mountains themselves and it was quite warm to swim in. We bobbed at the edge, gazing out over the view and enjoying being in the water...and of course getting some photos because it’s one of the most photogenic things I’ve basically ever seen. Fact.</p>\n\n    <p>It was pretty quiet with just one or two other people and I had a swim in the lower pool as well. This in theory being the cold one but it was barely any cooler than main pool above.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251334636_80cd3d42ed_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251684389_73ce054f91_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Even with the cloud cover, the sun was quite intense for the middle of the afternoon and so we eventually got out and popped back to our room for a shower. Then it was time for our included picnic because out schedule is nothing if not jam packed.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251416093_f408238f7a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251684659_8239737826_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The staff had set out a little spread for us on the grass, laid on a blanket under a tree. It was possibly the most love island thing I’ve ever seen. We kept hats and sunnies on against the sun, and leaned against the cushions, kicking off our shoes and investigating our treats. We had a large fruit plate, a pot of chocolate dipping sauce and another bottle of fizz to enjoy (I swear we were collecting them) but as the sun was making us feel fuzzy, we decided to save the bubbles. We tucked into apple, watermelon, melon and pineapple, cut into pretty shapes and I devoured the chocolate which Pete declined to show an interest in. There were also some tiny sour plum-like things: they were bitter and green and once we’d had an experimental nibble, we decided they were a no.</p>\n\n    <p>It was lovely, sitting among the greenery and munching on refreshing fruit. But after a while, the sun got to be a bit much and we decided to retreat, leaving behind the ants and a curious grasshopper, snacking the fizz bucket as we left.</p>\n\n    <p>We decided to spend a couple of hours resting in our room as we were both pretty tired. And when I thought about it, we’d had a series of days travelling, the night ahead would make it six nights in six different beds and the heat and humidity were also taking no small toll on our energy levels. Pete was battling a headache that wouldn’t budge and we didn’t want to push ourselves to do things just for the sake of it.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251921070_5910297109_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251421526_7a65293168_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>And actually, it did us a world of good. I caught up on some journalling, we could still see the mountain views from our room and it felt wonderfully luxurious just to lounge in the air con. Sometimes you just have to give yourself a bit of time.</p>\n\n    <p>As the sun was setting, I popped out to fill up our water bottles at the bar and to get some pictures of the mountain glowing in golden hour. The views were truly staggering - it seems daft to keep saying the mountain views were good but a) they were indescribably beautiful, b) they changed and shifted with the weather and the light and c) I don’t think I’ve ever stayed anywhere quite like the lodge where the panoramas are staring at you from every and all directions.</p>\n\n    <p>Behind the lodge, one pointed peak rose like a child’s drawing of a mountain: steep sides and pointy tops. The wind rippled the rice parading in its order rows up the terraces. Peaks faded out into ever more abstract grey lines in the the distance, losing detail to the haze and eventually vanishing into cloud. And the sun glowed, illuminating the sky and the horizon with soft golden light. The word lush didn’t do it justice.</p>\n\n    <p>I sat on the terrace outside the bar for a while, drinking in the scene and writing a little more in my journal. Trying to work out if the lodge was indeed the most beautiful place I had ever stayed in.</p>\n\n    <p>I returned to our room and found Pete on the balcony. Housekeeping had dropped round some biscuits - nice! - and we sat for a while, munching and enjoying our own private mountain landscapes.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251421521_b62d355a6f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52250448027_2cf61f8232_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Dinner time rolled round and we loaded up with all the bug spray we could muster and stepped into the dark evening. We would be having a barbecue dinner in the pavilion that evening, and we made our way to the little outdoor seating area, each little gazebo sheltering two or three tables. The insects where making an absolute racket, seemingly competing over who could make the most noise and we could pick our cicadas, grasshoppers, all manner of chirrupy things and we also thought probably frogs. I mean, there was plenty of water irrigating the terraces to keep them happy!</p>\n\n    <p>We took our seats and the waitress showed us the menu; it was a set dinner which was just as well as we couldn’t understand a word of the Vietnamese written on the page. We figured we’d just wait and see what appeared.</p>\n\n    <p>Candles were lit and while the odd moth flickered past and an enormous grasshopper rested its legs on the beams above us, we weren’t that bothered by insects. We could hear them get fried by the light machines every so often but as long as they didn’t besiege us with bites, we were game.</p>\n\n    <p>Our started arrived and it was huge: Vietnamese snails in a sticky chilli sauce, a big platter of ceviche and prawn crackers with some sort of dip.</p>\n\n    <p>We’d both had snails before but not Vietnamese ones and while I knew they were a thing from a food program I’d watched, it wasn’t a dish I had anticipated seeking out. Nevertheless, here was our chance to try them! Verdict? Well the sauce was yummy but the snails were so chewy that I felt like after a while you had to sort of give up and just gulp them down. Each one was two or three time the size of the ones I’d eaten before; they took quite a bit of wiggling to get them out of their shells and the flavour was mildly fishy, a bit like a prawn or a mussel.</p>\n\n    <p>But with so much more chew! And the problem with that is when you’ve had to prise it from its shell and spend about 45 minutes chewing it, its really hard not to be very aware that you’re eating a snail. So not bad, but I don’t think I’d choose them again. We ate two each - they were big! - and both opted out of snail number three.</p>\n\n    <p>The ceviche was good however as we’re the prawn crackers but I feel like they’re kind of a given.</p>\n\n    <p>The main was another huge serving, and perhaps somewhat less Vietnamese. We had barbecued aubergine, sweetcorn and veggie skewers (chargrilled and very tasty!), a green salad, a bowl of mash and a steak. I opted out of steak - it’s not something I love anyway and I assumed quite correctly that there would be enough food without it. Pete enjoyed his though.</p>\n\n    <p>They also brought us a little bowl of the awesome garlic-herb-pesto stuff we’d had a lunch which I dolloped liberally over everything.</p>\n\n    <p>Dessert was a fruit plate and a passionfruit cream mousse served inside a passionfruit. That was particularly delectable and I could have eaten about six of them as it was light and silky with perfect balance between sweet and tart.</p>\n\n    <p>After dinner we picked our way through the darkened paths, past the little open air cinema which seemed quaint in principle but which probably involved a huge number of bugs in practice, and filled out bottles at the bar. Then we headed back to our room to have an early night.</p>\n\n    <p>I made a round of tea and fell in love with yet another tea set. There were jars of loose leaf tea, mini teabags to make yourself, a carved wooden teaspoon and a pair of beautifully tactile ceramic mugs.</p>\n\n    <p>I get that the point of going to Vietnam is not the tea sets, but seriously, I feel like they’re onto a good thing here. Best hotel tea set up EVER.</p>\n\n    <p>Except for the lack of milk, but if you’re providing proper loose leaf tea, you’re allowed a bit of grace there and so I just filched some creamer out of my bag. We showered to remove the layer of bug spray, watched an episode of Lost and by half ten we were tucked up in bed under our mosquito netting canopy hoping to get a very solid night’s sleep, catch up with our rest and feel full of the joys of the mountains the next day. And so we drifted off to the symphony of the insects.</p>\n\n    <p>physicsinnit</p>\n\n</section>",

There wasn’t a window which didn’t really matter, but it did mean that the room was dark and quiet. It was also relatively spacious, had tea making facilities and an excellent shower. Lush!</p>\n\n    <p>The wifi was strong too so we looked into booking a taxi from Hanoi airport to our hotel. Our hotel had actually messaged Pete a couple of times to ask about this and we’d tried to take them up on the offer as the price was reasonable. But as they didn’t get back to us, Pete spent a frustrating 20 minutes wrangling with various online booking systems, finally achieving success and sending the payment. Handy as we didn’t have any local currency.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course, as soon as he’d done this, the hotel got back to us. Too late folks, sorry!</p>\n\n    <p>Once we were up and ready, showers showered and tea drunk, we emerged back into the airport in search of breakfast. A bit of wander showed us that there were loads of options if you’re after a slap up Chinese, but if you want a cuppa and pastry, you aren’t going to be lucky.</p>\n\n    <p>In the end we opted for subway, grabbing a breakfast sandwich each and a tea, which was hot and reasonably tasty and cheap. Problem solved.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course, it was after breakfast when things got all twisted up again. We queued to go through passport control but our boarding passes wouldn’t scan and we were sent to the check in desks where the queues were enormous. No amount of haranguing the queue automatons would get them to help us, the check in machines were worse than useless as instead of doing anything, they told you to check in online and even though I tried to do this, the website said our flight had already departed. Which, yes, the first leg of our booking, but the second hadn’t.</p>\n\n    <p>ARGH!!!!</p>\n\n    <p>The stupid thing is: we were checked in, we had printed boarding passes, we had dropped our bags: all we needed to do was go through security. And yet we were made to go through the entire rigmarole for NOTHING. Suckfest.</p>\n\n    <p>I will admit that perhaps my irritation was disproportionate to the situation but seriously. If we missed our flight because of this, I felt like I would actually need to scratch somebody’s eyes out.</p>\n\n    <p>We split up to join different queues, but we’re both sent off to join yet another queue in a different part of the airport. Which made no sense. We joined different queues again and crossed our fingers. There was still an hour to go until boarding but the queues barely seemed to move and none of the check in staff seemed willing or able to to anything to help or answer our questions, just telling us to queue.</p>\n\n    <p>Eventually I reached the front of my queue and we had to go through the rigmarole of passport, vaccine status, proof of flight out of Singapore all over again which was also ridiculous as we were already checked in. But eventually we were given new boarding passes and could go back to rejoining the passport control queue.</p>\n\n    <p>Then there were two rounds of security for reasons unknown but at least they were relatively snappy, and finally, after a miserable hour and a half, we were at our gate. Time to put on a shiny new positive attitude.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52230351593_de5314a910_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251803480_f3ae0f8c5c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We did another round of passports, boarding passes and visas, and then a second round of passports (technically about our 28th go round of passports but they sure love looking at them in KL) and then we slumped in seat to wait for boarding and I polished off the last of my favourite Indonesian biscuits. YUM.</p>\n\n    <p>We boarders the plane and took off: the first hour or so was pretty turbulent which always makes me nervous. I felt like the bottom dropped out of my stomach. Things seemed to calm down a bit after that and I buried myself in the next Harry Potter film to try and take mind off things.</p>\n\n    <p>We landed in Vietnam at 3:00pm local time - only about 2 years and 4 months later than originally planned! We cleared through immigration quite quickly, grabbed our bags and went to look for our ride. Interestingly, border control in Indonesia and in Malaysia had demanded to see our Vietnamese visas, but Vietnam never asked about them. Classic.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete managed to get in touch with our driver via WhatsApp and we arranged a spot to meet. Before long, we were bowling along to Hanoi towards our hotel for the evening.</p>\n\n    <p>It was interesting watching the city slide past the windows. It had lots of the same features of cities in south east Asia we’ve visited before - crowds of motorbike, lots of stalls which spill into the street and so on - but it just looked a bit more put together than Medan and Malang, and the Indonesian cities we’d left behind. There were some quite obvious colonial nods here and there and we were looking forward to exploring and making our first foray into Vietnam!</p>\n\n    <p>We pitched up at our hotel which was very welcoming and the receptionist gave us lots of useful information. We clattered up to our room to regroup and plan our evening and before too long we were changed and ready to dive head first into Hanoi!</p>\n\n    <p>It was already gone 5:00pm and as we hadn’t eaten since our breakfast subway, we were pretty eager to get chomping. But first we needed cash. The first 3 ATMs we visited that were listed on our map were non-existent so Pete decided we should aim for a bank instead. There we had more luck, found a functioning ATM and withdrew about 4 million dong. RICH!</p>\n\n    <p>Our next port of call was for a pre-dinner snack as we were eager to try banh goi: little pasty/samosa/empanada type goodies stuffed with pork and whatnot. Our map let us down again though and we couldn’t find the morsel in question. Instead, we ended up at the side of Hoan Kiem lake and decided to walk around it. It was super hot (36 degrees) and we were already sticky with sweat but it was so nice to be out after a long period of travel that we didn’t really mind.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52250330552_c05b199deb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52250334827_ab41d6b7d4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was golden hour and loads of people were out enjoying the last few rays of the day. We walked past 3 groups of ladies doing a sort of combo of dancing and exercise - a bit like a slow motion zumba, or possibly tai chi to music - and actually they weren’t the only ones using the lakeside path to get active. However, possibly our favourite moment was when a small girl approached us and launched expectantly in with “Hello what’s your name?”.</p>\n\n    <p>She must have been around 6 or 7 and clutched a sheet of paper and a pencil. I told her my name and spelled it for her and she wrote it down carefully.</p>\n\n    <p>She then proceeded down a list of questions that she had on her sheet: where was I from, how long was I in Hanoi, what was my favourite thing in Hanoi (I was frantically grasping for any local knowledge from what was approximately one hour of personal experience) and where was I going next. She also asked who I was with and carefully wrote down “huspand” in the box as I couldn’t find a way to communicate the letter B.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete is now my lovely huspanda and he can like it.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, midway through my interview, a small boy cautiously approached Pete and started asking him the same list of questions.</p>\n\n    <p>They had clearly been tasked with approaching a particular number of foreigners to practise their English and to write down the information in the grid. But they were so sweet and polite and unerringly earnest that it was really fun to help them out. I asked the girl interviewing me if it was a school project which she confirmed.</p>\n\n    <p>While Pete was finishing up his questionnaire, two more girls hovered in my vicinity looking hopeful, so I answered questions for them too. Probably this is what it’s like being famous.</p>\n\n    <p>Assuming all reporters are basically really adorable primary school children with excellent manners.</p>\n\n    <p>Once we’d answered all the questions put to us, my huspanda and I wandered on around the rest of the lake, enjoying the colours in the sky fading through pale blues, pinks and yellows and admiring the bridge over to the central island. Greenery surrounded the water, pink grasses and reeds waves softly and fruit sellers started to populate the area with their stall and wares.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251807865_fe202da683_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52250330472_ce8f15b0e3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Time for dinner! We were starving and headed off to find Cha Ca Thang Long. I had read about this place on a food blog a few days ago, and it was also on the list of recommended places our hotel had given us. Add in that it was within easy walking distance and we were sold.</p>\n\n    <p>Cha Ca is in fact the name of the dish we were after. We were a little confused when it came to finding the entrance, but a chap outside helped us and we were soon inside and gesturing for a table for 2. It was busy but they shuffled us into the back on a table by the counter and the waiter that served us just held up 2 fingers to check we were both eating. We confirmed yep, food for 2 and without having seen any sort of menu or anything, we hoped the right thing would come.</p>\n\n    <p>And boy did it ever! Cha Ca is a catfish dish cooked and served at the table, and as lots of little pots of extras and toppings started arriving, the waiter lit up the gas ring between us and got to work. He added the catfish to the pan where it cooked and sizzled, coated in turmeric and other spices to make it super delicious. The smell wafting across to us was immense. On top of this he added a huge pile of dill and spring onion which gradually cooked down, and he stirred it with chopsticks occasionally. Every so often, he’d pop away to sort someone else, gesturing to us not to do anything, and then coming back again.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52250330377_90e4385180_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251803450_5d656f29fa_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once it was ready, he showed us how to serve ourselves. We each had a little bowl into which we first put some sticky vermicelli. On top of that went some of the fried greens and a chunk or two of catfish from the pan. Then we used the condiments, adding fresh spring onion, coriander, peanuts and finally, a spoonful of fish sauce infused with chilli.</p>\n\n    <p>Scoff and repeat until your pan is empty. YUM!!!</p>\n\n    <p>It was so good - possibly my favourite meal of the trip so far! - and after the challenges we’d faced trying to get places and try food in Indonesia, it was a welcome buzz to be able to wander round a new city and access some of its tastiest delights. 11 out of 10 would recommend.</p>\n\n    <p>This feats plus a drink each set us back £12 which were pretty happy with and we ventured back out into the now-dark streets feeling very satisfied.</p>\n\n    <p>We decided to go and find somewhere for a drink and Pete led the way to an area the hotel receptionist had described as “beer street” where apparently there were lots of bars and you could sit in the street, enjoy the night sir and put away a cheeky beverage.</p>\n\n    <p>We weren’t exactly sure which was the right street so Pete picked a place at random in the end. I say at random: there was a big red sign saying Peter so maybe he was a tiny bit unknowingly subconsciously influenced or something.</p>\n\n    <p>But probably not.</p>\n\n    <p>We ordered a beer each and perched on the tiny plastic stools at the side of the road. This is a classic part of pretty much any Vietnamese business: child-size plastic chairs and stools at low tables filling up the edges of the streets to pack in the punters.</p>\n\n    <p>The place wasn’t busy and it was so lovely to just sit and evening the evening, chatting and laughing. We’d kind of missed doing this in Indonesia we realised, as it hadn’t really been possibly partly because lots of the places we visited didn’t serve drink, and partly because I was such a pain to get anywhere. It was fun to watch the world go by too: young tourists labouring under massive backpacks - our favourites being a couple where the guy carried his own massive backpack and pulled his girlfriend’s suitcase. Street sellers tried to flog us bits and bobs, a couple of guys delivered some live crabs and crayfish to the tanks behind us and motorbikes trundled past, weaving this way and that through the street clutter.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251319263_85b0202811_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251301741_9873e88f29_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was still very warm even though the sun had long since set, but a bit of a breeze was welcome. We finished our drinks, made a quick stop at Circle K and headed back to our hotel.</p>\n\n    <p>Circle K is the Vietnamese equivalent of Indomart, which is the Indonesian 7 Eleven and so we figured it would be good to get the May of the land and choose some snackos. We opted for a packet of ice cream flavour Oreos, some M&Ms and an ice cream sandwich each, strawberry for Pete and chocolate for me.</p>\n\n    <p>We ate the ice creams as we wandered back and it was lovely to munch on something cold. Plus they were super yummy: the ice creams were shaped like fish, had a layer of flavoured syrup inside and were enclosed in a soft, wafer-like coating. I knew I would be on the look out for another one during our time in Vietnam!</p>\n\n    <p>Back at the hotel, I got up to day with my journal before making a round of tea. The hotel room came with really beautiful teacups and o developed secret designs on them. To distract myself, Pete and I watched an episode of Lost and attacked our snackies: the verdict was a thumbs down from me on the Oreos, while Pete thought they were OK, and the M&Ms were just averagely fine, as M&Ms usually are. I’d just fancied a bit of chocolate really.</p>\n\n    <p>Around half eleven, we gathered our things together and got ready for bed. We had another early start in the morning as we would be leaving Hanoi for a couple of days to visit Sapa. And with a 6:00am alarm, it’s always a good idea to try and prioritise a bit of sleep! So with bags mostly packed (and the teacups still safely in the possession of the hotel) we settled down for the night.</p>\n\n</section>",

They flipping love an appliance do those little lizards.</p>\n\n    <p>I read a little, enjoying lounging in bed and eventually Pete woke too. It was nice to shut off the alarms and just lie for a bit.</p>\n\n    <p>At nine we headed over to the lodge for breakfast, ordering tea and scrambled gags on toast again. The scrambled egg sandwich was just as delicious as last time - seriously epic stuff - but the tea had been completely drowned in sugar which the waitress proudly announced when she brought our drinks.</p>\n\n    <p>It set our teeth on edge! We drank it anyway, leaving at least a spoonful of sugar floating around in the bottom of the cups undissolved (seriously, how much sugar was in it?) and looked forward to brewing up a better cup ourselves that evening. There was also the lurking possibility of acquiring milk...</p>\n\n    <p>We packed our bags ready to depart Bukit Lawang and waiting for our ride to begin the journey back to Medan. The same driver as before showed up bang on time and we checked out, shaking hands and saying thank yous before loading up our backpacks and hitting the road.</p>\n\n    <p>We hadn’t gone far when we had to stop at the side of the road to give the driver the address; he didn’t seem super confident about this but figured I could help with navigation if necessary nearer the city.</p>\n\n    <p>A motorbike overtook us and pulled up in front and it turned out to be the chap from the lodge who’d chased us down. He had a rapid conversation with our driver through the window and they both laughed before turning to us and saying he’d forgotten to hand over petrol money to the driver. The driver in turn laughed, explaining to us: “He forget, I forget! No petrol, no drive!”</p>\n\n    <p>He wasn’t wrong.</p>\n\n    <p>The first couple of hours we slow and over the little rural bumpy roads peppered with potholes. I listened to my audiobook and dozed a little - I have a hard time staying awake on transport it seems - until a little after midday when we stopped for the driver to have a smoke.</p>\n\n    <p>Then we were on our way again, rumbling through the outskirts of Medan in heavier and heavier traffic.</p>\n\n    <p>We pulled up to our hotel at around half one - we had managed to direct the driver for the last section of the trip and he told us the name of the hotel had changed which was why he hadn’t known where it was.</p>\n\n    <p>We were a little early to check in so plopped down in the lobby to wait for our room. However, it didn’t take long for a room to be ready, and while we had to faff around with the lift for a while as our key cards didn’t work, reception sorted us out and we we able to shrug off our bags in our room and slump onto the bed. Phew!</p>\n\n    <p>We sorted out our trek laundry which needed doing badly enough that we decided to pay the inflated hotel prices and get it down overnight. Meanwhile, a quick recce of the surrounding area online revealed a few Indomart and so forth within walking distance, and we were soon off out in search of some sustenance.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course, we had neglected to consider that walking distance is a meaningless term in these wretched Indonesian cities where you can’t get anywhere on foot. There’s no pavement, the traffic doesn’t stick to its lanes - or the road - and anything that might plausibly be a gap is instantly filled with motorbikes buzzing around wherever they like.</p>\n\n    <p>HOW DOES ANYONE GET ANYWHERE EVER???</p>\n\n    <p>We traipsed around, for a bit, walking in broken gutters and dodging an unpleasant smelling stream of water and trying to make progress, but it was about as effective as banging our heads against the wall. The place we were initially aiming for was across a 4 lane road and after standing forlornly next to it for a while with no visible means of crossing, we abandoned that. Pete had marked a couple of other places on his map, but after tramping around for twenty minutes or so in the rain - because of course it was raining - we had to abandon these places and decided to go back to the hotel and regroup using the wifi. Nightmare.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately, our route back happened to take us past an Alfamart. Not quite as good as Indomart in our opinion, but still able to supply tea, milk-like liquid (we still aren’t sure what it is but it does the job), our favourite biscuits, some noods and some crisps. Plus water. Shopping list complete.</p>\n\n    <p>We trailed back to the hotel with our spoils and made a bit of DIY lunch. The noodles were a different brand to the ones we usually buy. On the up side, they came with their own forks and mine had 4 sachets of different powders and sauces to add, but they weren’t as good as our usual. However, they were perfectly tasty and filled us up, and with a cup of tea and a biscuit or two down as well, we were ready to make a plan.</p>\n\n    <p>We both agreed we were kind of done with the noise, pollution, general grime and chaos of massive Indonesian cities. That didn’t meant we hadn’t had a great time or that Indonesia isn’t amazing and fascinating. But as backpackers who want to be able to trot along to places on foot or hail a cheap ride in whatever passes for local transport, we were thwarted at every turn and it made even simple tasks just seem so much more complicated. It was draining. Unless you can fork out for a driver for the day to ferry you back and forth, it’s just a nightmare.</p>\n\n    <p>So we gave ourselves permission to spend the evening in, after the frustrations of our earlier short jaunt. We decided to work on the blog for a bit, have a hot shower apiece and another round of tea, have dinner in the hotel and save venturing out for the next day. We made a plan, it involved only one round of desperately seeking some means of transport and it meant that would be able to make something positive of both our last day in Medan and our last day in Indonesia.</p>\n\n    <p>That decided, I think we both felt much better: a combination of satisfaction in a plan worked out and relief that we would need to battle Medan until the following day. Hurrah!</p>\n\n    <p>I think it’s easy while travelling to think that every minute has to be filled with important and meaningful experiences. But our round the world trip taught us that kind of pace isn’t sustainable for more than a couple of weeks. We were on a 7 week trip, we had already had loads of incredible experiences and spending one afternoon in the hotel wasn’t a bad thing at all. We were working together on our blog which brings us both considerable joy and satisfaction, we were loving being together and we were both much happier and more relaxed having a quiet day than pushing ourselves to tick off some boxes for the sake of it.</p>\n\n    <p>With 4 blog posts under our collective belt, we decided to head for dinner. We had some confusion with our key cards in making the lift work again, but given that there was another chap in the lift having similar issues we started to figure it wasn’t on us.</p>\n\n    <p>The hotel restaurant was on the 7th floor. It was a bit strange as the carpet down the whole corridor was wet and 3 large fans were finding out a lot of noise and presumably, a lot of air to dry the carpet.</p>\n\n    <p>The restaurant was virtually empty but when we went to take a seat by the window, the waiter told us we couldn’t sit there as there was a private party.</p>\n\n    <p>We look around: there was literally one bloke sitting eating by himself. In the whole place. A very private party indeed.</p>\n\n    <p>Instead, we went and sat around the corner in a different window and this seemed to be OK. We split a portion of spring rolls, I had a bowl of pasta and Pete a club and sandwich and it was pretty tasty, even though the ambiance was somewhat odd. There was also quite a gap between things arriving: my pasta first which I’d finished by the time the spring rolls arrived. Then eventually Pete’s sandwich. But hey, how often do you actually get to sit and watch each other eat? That’s not weird.</p>\n\n    <p>We paid and left and as we did, one of the kitchen staff wheeled a giant fridge through the restaurant. Again: somewhat odd.</p>\n\n    <p>Back in our room, I made a round of tea</p>\n\n    <h1>Day 19</h1>\n\n    <p>The hotel, while a bit... odd?...had the comfiest bed we’d slept in for a while and it was lovely to feel properly relaxed again. Admittedly I could have lived workout the pre-set alarms on the room clock radio - trying to work out how to shut it off at six and then again at seven was a little trying - but I dropped off again quite easily both times.</p>\n\n    <p>We got up and went for breakfast a little after nine. Again the restaurant was empty apart from another couple, but we took in the buffet and set to.</p>\n\n    <p>I got us some scrambled eggs from the egg station and I added some fried noodles and prawn crackers to my plate. Pete however had managed to locate the cake station (my initial sweep had missed this) and brought me a banana muffin. Winner!</p>\n\n    <p>In fact it was so yummy that I popped back for another and ended up snagging the last one. Plus some pineapple and a slice of toast with peanut butter. Covering all the major food groups.</p>\n\n    <p>Tea was a bit of a lost cause however so we pottered back to our room and prepared for the day, showering, making tea, packing our bags for the day, figuring out what we’d for our flight later and pushing another blog post live.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242303003_1119d93e67_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It was handy not to check out until noon and we’d enjoyed a good lie in and having the time to get our things together. With everything ready, we settled our bill at reception, asked them to store our bags and got a taxi to our location for the day: Tjong A Fie Mansion.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258954970_38ac8847f6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258748559_73ed6d0f11_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The Mansion was, unsurprisingly, home to Tjong A Fie, the chap who became the leader of the the Chinese population in Medan in the 1900s. Sumatra at the time was a bit of a cultural melting pot with Chinese and Malaysian workers arriving from Singapore, Dutch Colonial rule, strong Indian connection and an English link somewhere in there as well because the flipping British can never keep their sticky fingers to themselves when there might be a pie they can shove them in.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258481968_b6ab0988c7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258954010_68a0da29a0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Consequently, while Tjong A Fie was part of the Peranakan culture, this culture had a number of influences: Portugal, the Netherlands, Britain, India and China. Many of these influences can be seen in the mansion which has been described as being built in the “Chinese-European-Art-Deco” style. If that’s not a combo, I don’t know what is.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242291181_62b13b358f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242302211_28b29b5598_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Visiting the mansion and wandering it’s rooms is a great way to get a bit of an insight into the old Medan and it cost us a fraction over £2 each to get in. Or 70 000 rupiah in total.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258466221_c22d466d25_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The mansion was beautiful: we started with the ground floor and took our time, slowly exploring and admiring the details which drew from so many different world influences. While the decor and structure were perhaps looking a bit vintage with age, there was still a kind of Venetian grandeur to it. The rooms were enormous with high, crafty ceilings, the windows mostly free of glass to let in the breeze, and courtyards filled with plants and lined with intricate wooden shutters created an airy feel.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242291141_91356ecf05_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242577019_8f4818543d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We learned that Tjong A Fie was a Chinese immigrant, but that he rose to power and prominence by acting as an interface between the Dutch Colonialists, the Chinese workers and the Indonesian natives. While this undoubtedly required a fair bit of savvy and diplomacy, he also seemed to have done pretty well for himself out of the situation and made a fair whack of cash. He was apparently the first person in Medan to own a car.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242588024_62960ee7a2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241322407_c27888992e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>While he must have been a pretty slick operator, it also seemed that he managed to keep a pretty neutral stance between the conflicting interests of the different parties. For example, he maintained strong friendships with the Dutch while still opposing the working conditions forced upon Chinese immigrant workers.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242793630_401eb20abd_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242313633_a32e3bc0d2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We admired the paintings and artwork - Pete especially admired the inlaid pieces - and there was a pretty amazing collection of teaware which I would happily have helped myself to had I thought it would fit in my luggage.</p>\n\n    <p>Also, I suppose it would be stealing, so there’s that too.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241327982_b74b6a652a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242626509_5943d3d4c9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Chinese influences could be seen in the carved screens and the hanging lanterns, the blue and white shutters let in lovely light filtered by green plants and the rooms were decorated with striking colours: vibrant yellow and bold reds. It was a great place to spend the afternoon and gave us an insight into a very different side of Medan’s history and culture. A far cry from the noisy, industrial city of today.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258479838_be5fac2f84_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Once we’d left the museum, we played roulette with various cash machines until we persuaded one to cough up some money (and even then, it told us to get a new card, weird) and then headed down the road to get a bite to eat. This sounds innocuous, but the fact that we were able to head down the road is a testament to the pavement. There actually was one!</p>\n\n    <p>We were heading for Tip Top cafe and ice cream parlour which was a few doors down. We’d read an article recommending it and it was a bit of a Medan institution, having been founded way back in 1934. It has a properly old-school colonial frontage, photos showing allied troops marching past during WWII it seemed like the ideal place to have a little rest from the head of the day.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241375547_5cb8f940b3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242356691_8e6a191f23_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Of course we both ordered ice cream: I opted for a slice of Neapolitan and Pete had a peach Melba sundae. We accompanied this with a mixed fruit juice: no idea what was in it but it was tasty and refreshing which was mostly the point.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, we enjoyed this so much that Pete opted for a second ice cream, this time managing to pic a slice of Neapolitan ice cream that also had a cherry on top, a layer of sponge cake and a couple of pieces of fruit inside. I was slightly miffed that he’d managed to out-order me.</p>\n\n    <p>Finding a pavement had made us cocky so we decided to see if we could walk up the road to a nearby park (and maybe even grab a cup of tea at Starbucks because sometimes I’m that basic). We made a pretty decent lick of it, getting all the way there on foot and having to cross only one insanely busy road. In fact, there was a ti y pedestrian island in the middle where some influencers were filming fashion type content so that gave us a break from the incessant vehicles.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242340851_ea33de1376_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241327962_27301fccd6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The park proved to be a disappointment. First we had to walk most of the way round it to get in, and then it proved to be largely featureless and a bit run down. There was an abandoned skate park, a sad-looking pavilion where some kids were practising their dance moves, quite a lot of litter and weird smell. Not top park attributes really.</p>\n\n    <p>One of the dancing kids came over and showed Pete his phone where he’d translated “can I get a picture with you” so we posed for that, but I was very much a spare part and it was a picture of Pete they were more interested in.</p>\n\n    <p>And then we shuffled away again. The Starbucks was not where the map said it was, so we figured we’d pop back to the hotel lobby and wait for our flight time there.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242626619_17ffa46c72_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242340961_6cc0d25723_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>As always, getting back to the hotel was not straightforward. We managed to find the train station which was near the park, and there were some taxis but all were driverless. Another very strange taxi rank. Maybe you’re supposed to just take one and drive yourself?</p>\n\n    <p>We mooched up and down the full length of the station locating neither a cafe nor anywhere to find transport. We decided to try back at the taxi rank again and this time we had better luck: a driver was relaxing across the street, but leapt up and dashed towards us when he spotted us coming. We had a ride!</p>\n\n    <p>So of course then we felt horribly guilty when it turned out we didn’t have the right change for the journey. The driver couldn’t break a note so ended up taking all our small change, driving away a couple of thousand rupiah short of his fee. Eep.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52258465221_cc8b77f4ed_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We had a couple of hours to kill in the lobby - journal time and photo editing time ahoy - and then summoned a taxi to take us to the airport. We had looked into a train but at 100000 rupiah apiece, it seemed the airport train worked on the Heathrow Express principle of only being a good option if you don’t know any better. If you do know better, you appreciate it costs about 7 times what it’s worth for a journey that won’t take you much longer if you go by tube.</p>\n\n    <p>Given that if we went by train, we’d need to get a taxi to the station, it seemed to be about the same price just to get a taxi to the airport. This six o’clock found us bowling along the streets of Medan in a cab.</p>\n\n    <p>I speak figuratively. We were jammed in traffic in the streets of the Medan but the end goal was the same.</p>\n\n    <p>We pulled up at the airport a little after seven, the taxi driver inexplicably added 40000 rupiah to the fare which ate up most of his tip as I didn’t have any extra change after that. Sad face.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242626654_442abc67bc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52242793595_5f218bbd7f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We had arrived at the airport at the recommended 3 hours in advance, figuring we’d check in, stash our bags and grab some dinner. The airport had other ideas, and we were told that check in wouldn’t open until eight. However, Pete had spotted a Starbucks and so we trotted across to find some tea and wait for the desk to open.</p>\n\n    <p>There was a slight snag in that Starbucks had sold out of tea. But after some acrobatic miming, I convinced them to give me two cups of hot water and some cold milk (which turned out to be free: score!!!) and then I secretly pulled out some teabags stashed in my luggage to make our own tea. So not checking in the bags turned out to be a good thing!</p>\n\n    <p>I also grabbed a scone and Pete had a panini - I was actually obliged to pay for these - and we whiled away the time until our flight with a slightly more caffeinated spring in our step.</p>\n\n    <p>We checked in, and there was a slight hiccup when the airline chap told us we could only stay in Vietnam for 15 days. Which was weird as we had visas for 30 days. After some rummaging, I was able to produce our paperwork and he agreed that it would be OK. But things like that always throw you for a second!</p>\n\n    <p>Our bags disappeared to meet us 2 lights later in Hanoi and we went through security. Time for dinner!</p>\n\n    <p>Except we hit another mini snag. At the advanced hour of 8:15, all the airport eateries had closed. There were a couple of small shops open but they wouldn’t take cards. So once we’d managed to stretch our remaining currency to a packet of crisps and some biscuits that was it for the night.</p>\n\n    <p>We kind of wished we’d had more at Starbucks, but I suppose they wouldn’t have taken our card either.</p>\n\n    <p>This has been a recurring feature of our time in Indonesia: shops invariably have a card machine on the counter but at least 2 times out of 3, they tell us they don’t take cards. We assumed we would be OK at the airport, but apparently not,</p>\n\n    <p>So we sat in our gate to wait the hour to our flight. As we boarded there was no small amount of confusion as people kept changing seats, but once that was sorted, we were off.</p>\n\n    <p>It was a short flight through the dark skies, and in just over an hour’s time, landed in Kuala Lumpur. We shuffled off the plane and made our way through the airport, hunting out the signs for our airport hotel. We weren’t actually planning to spend any time in Malaysia, but we had a 12 hour layover. It had been cheaper to get from Medan to Hanoi overnight including a night in the airport hotel than it had been to travel at more sensible times with shorter transfers. And given that we weren’t all that bothered where we slept as long as there was a bed, a night in the Kuala Lumpur airport hotel worked a treat.</p>\n\n    <p>Finding the hotel proved a little more tricky than we thought though. We got through immigration and passport control without incident (a relief as we hadn’t been able to get the Malaysian covid app to work properly despite repeated attempts over the last 3 weeks) and followed the signs to the airport train. The instructions the hotel had sent me said that we would be able to find them on the right of the train station on level 2.</p>\n\n    <p>We found level 2. We found the train station. Pete spotted an enormous sigh for the hotel. And yet there was no actual hotel that we could see.</p>\n\n    <p>We did a few laps of level 2, visiting the closed food court, a bank of ATMs, the station and a various retail outlets in the mall section. It was starting to get ridiculous: it was 1:00am, we wanted to go to bed and we ended up standing right under the hotel sign wondering how to get in.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete spotted a security guard and fortunately he was able to put us right: the hotel was on level three.</p>\n\n    <p>I feel like we would actually have managed better without the stupid instructions the hotel sent us. If we hadn’t been told to be on level 2 we might have tried other floors ourselves. Sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>I mean, why bother taking the time to send out information to guests if it’s not accurate????</p>\n\n    <p>It’s OK: I’m over it.</p>\n\n    <p>We did indeed find reception on level 3, summoned a member of staff and got checked in. We wandered through the maze of corridors to find our room, only to discover that the key card didn’t work. We hadn’t been having much luck with key cards lately.</p>\n\n    <p>Back to reception: it took a little longer to summon up a member of staff the second time round, but we managed, and she escorted us back to our room with a new card. Possibly to check all was well, but also possibly because she thought maybe we were too moronic to use a key card.</p>\n\n    <p>The new card worked, I made a cup of tea and we settled into our room. It was dwell equipped and handy now we knew where it was and we had plenty of time to rest, have morning cuppa and a hot shower. The hotel had an interesting but practical reservation system where you got the room for 12 hours from the time you check in. Ideal as it works around whatever weird and wonderful flight times you may have. And so we tumbled into bed, Pete to sleep and me to finish the end of this journal entry.</p>\n\n    <p>And to start planning my #bringbackkeys #downwithkeycards campaign.</p>\n\n    <p>Sweet dreams!</p>\n\n    <p>bringbackkeys downwithkeycards</p>\n\n</section>",

I was awake by half seven and read under the mosquito net for a bit, listening to the river which had dropped back to the level of the previous afternoon.</p>\n\n    <p>Eventually I got up, slipping out from under our mosquito net, leaving Pete asleep and wrapped in his blanket. I went to put on my trekking clothes and discovered that they were sodden. Not just from the previous day’s trek but because clearly where we’d hung up our clothes to dry out wasn’t as sheltered as we imagined. I did put on my sports bra but it was so went and clammy that I couldn’t face wearing the rest of my gear and figured I’d just stick to wearing the dry t-shirt and leggings I’d been sleeping in. It was our last day in the jungle after all.</p>\n\n    <p>I could see our guides laying out the mat by the river for breakfast; the morning was a little cooler than the previous ones which was nice, and it was dry, with the sun peering through the cloud here and there. I woke Pete and wandered down to the side of the river.</p>\n\n    <p>When Pete arrived, there was a jug of tea waiting for us and we have the packet of biscuits a miss, remembering the breakfast onslaught of the day before and saving room. Breakfast was indeed another feast - the same triple decker sandwich with egg, cheese and salad and garnished with a selection of fruit: lychees, passionfruit, banana and orange.</p>\n\n    <p>It was lovely to sit by the river listening to the rush of water and the occasional squawks from small birds, while large butterflies drifted around without any clear aim beyond the desire to flutter.</p>\n\n    <p>We had the option of doing another small hike in the morning, but given the state (and, let’s the honest, the smell) of our gear and the fact that the hike would just be slogging up the ridge and back down again, we opted out. Time to return to Bukit Lawang.</p>\n\n    <p>We retreated to our shelter and packed our wet things away - my towel was the worst affected item as it seemed to have positively absorbed water, sponge-style. I get that a towel is supposed to absorb water to some extent, but I figure it’s meant to absorb water off me when I’m wet, not somehow suck in an entire jungle storm.</p>\n\n    <p>As we packed, a small monkey wandered along the ledge in front of our shelter. Spotting us inside, it peered curiously at us before clambering up one of the poles to the roof. It’s face soon appeared again as it looked in at us, upside down from above, teeth bared. We hissed and flapped at it until we convinced it to wonder off. Seriously: monkeys.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239707106_1611d57e39_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239715583_bb452e07ed_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We ventured back to the river bank with our bags packed, our swimmers on and our few remaining dry items wrapped securely in our dry bags, stuffed inside our packs. The way back to Bukit Lawang was down the river!</p>\n\n    <p>But first, it seemed it was time for a fruit break as we were summoned to the kitchen tent and each handed a huge platter of fruit - our 195 a day - to eat before the journey.</p>\n\n    <p>It was approximately 15 minutes since we’d finished breakfast. And trust me when I say our journey back to Bukit Lawang was in no way going to be strenuous. But we propped down on the mat and tackled the fruit as best we could: melon, watermelon, orange, pineapple, passionfruit and lychee piled up and we were even offered a sachet of condensed milk to pour over the top.</p>\n\n    <p>We munched as much as we could while the guides and some of the other campers took it in turns to throw rocks at a target on the other side of the river. It was quite a distance to fling the rocks and nearly all missed, bouncing harmlessly off the far bank and rolling into the water, or scything through the ferns into the undergrowth.</p>\n\n    <p>We managed perhaps half a plate each before our fruit tolerance gave out: we were were just going to have to try and survive and avoid scurvy on about 128 of our 5 a day.</p>\n\n    <p>I had sealed my phone inside my dry bag inside my bag, otherwise I would have taken a picture of the fruit plate. It defied imagination.</p>\n\n    <p>As we ate, promising never to utter the phrase “but what about second breakfast?” again, the guides were busy preparing. They loaded our shoes and bags into strong, double lined plastic sacks, lashing them closed and then tied the bundles securely to our boat.</p>\n\n    <p>Boat is an optimistic term. So is raft really. Our ride was in fact three rubber rings lashed together. We were going to float back!</p>\n\n    <p>Pete and I sat together in the largest, middle ring, the water cold and fresh as we sank into the hole. Our feet dangled over the front as we wedged in tight. Then with one guide in the front ring, one guide it the back, and one perched on the side by me, we were ready for off! The two guides in the front and rear had long bamboo poles to push our makeshift raft along and we began to float downstream.</p>\n\n    <p>Despite the rain the previous night, it was dry season and so the river level wasn’t particularly high. It was enough to mostly keep us afloat though and our dashing captains guided the little craft through the right channels. We splashed and bounced over little rapids, waves of water splashing over us, the sun shone and we watched the immensity of the jungle slide slowly past. We saw a family of tufty grey monkeys playing by the river, most of whom scarpered as we paddled on past. The alpha stayed sitting on his rock though, so show he was not afraid of such trifles.</p>\n\n    <p>As we slipped and slid (and once or twice got stuck) downriver, the guide in the lead sang, teaching us a catchy song to the tune of jingle bells that even now is reverberating around inside my head:</p>\n\n    <p>Jungle trek, jungle trek,<br />\n    In Bukit Lawang.<br />\n    See the monkey, see the birds,<br />\n    See orang-utan!</p>\n\n    <p>Jungle trek, jungle trek,<br />\n    In Bukit Lawang.<br />\n    See the monkey, see the tiger,<br />\n    Everybody run!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240202675_49915559a2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239715593_dba147b4c7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>It took us around 45 minutes to get back to the village we’d left behind. We passed quite a few people on the river banks either hiking or trekking rubber rings and equipment out to the camping stations. We waved merrily, enjoying the ride, the rush whenever we splashed over white water and the sensation of just lying back and gliding through territory that had previously demanded an enormous effort.</p>\n\n    <p>When we reached Bukit Lawang, we were surprised to see that most of the population seemed to have turned out to play in the river. Little stalls lined the banks, families and groups clustered on the shore or played on the rocks in the water and sound systems played out pop hits. It was definitely party time and there was an almost bank holiday feel as everyone turned out to enjoy the sunshine and the cool water. Lots of people called and waved to us and it was really fascinating to watch a community making the most of their day. We laughed and waved back.</p>\n\n    <p>Finally we pitched up on a shallow, stoney bank and climbed out of the little vessel that could. Our packs were freed from their plastic protection, and we shouldered them and picked up our boots before walking back the five minutes or so to our hotel, dripping slightly in our swimwear and slapping along in flip flops.</p>\n\n    <p>All in all, it had been an amazing few days, but it was also lovely to be back to somewhere where a shower is a possibility rather than a vague concept. We got the keys to our room in the lodge, retrieved our packs from storage and said goodbye to our guide.</p>\n\n    <p>Then we stumbled inside and surveyed our things.</p>\n\n    <p>A shower did wonders for both of us, and feeling much cleaner and perkier, we set about sorting out our backpacks and our trekking bags. I divided up my gear into two piles: things that smell bad and are wet, and things that smell bad and are dry,</p>\n\n    <p>Pete just had one pile: things that smell bad.</p>\n\n    <p>We very much hoped we’d be able to get a little bit of laundry done the next day, but we spread out the damp things as much as we could, hoping they might at least air out a bit and the collapsed onto the bed. Even though we’d had reasonably long nights in bed, jungle trekking still seems to be quite demanding, especially with the added heat and humidity, and we were suddenly hit with weariness now we could relax. So we spent a quiet hour or so with a cup of tea, some journal time (for me) and some Star Trek time (for Pete).</p>\n\n    <p>We ended up watching the end of the Chamber of Secrets together before wandering out to the lodge’s garden. The river party was still in full flow with live music and loads of locals swimming and playing in the river. We leaned over to watch from the verandah and we were met with a chorus of “Hello mister, hello miss! Swimming! Cold!” as people waved.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239997214_7d0ff64637_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We sat in the open upper floor of the lodge to read and rest, passing the afternoon quite happily.</p>\n\n    <p>We succumbed to the heat and the lure of air con as the sky began to darken for the end of the day, and so we headed back to our room to watch an episode of Lost before dinner. Enroute, I could hear little staccato bird noises which seemed to come from the trees and vines beside me, but I couldn’t locate the author of the noises. That is, until I rounded the corner and spotted the local rooster strutting about. He continued his mild clucking for a while, before finally indulging in a proper cock-a-doodle-doo as we let ourselves into our room.</p>\n\n    <p>For some reason, it kept this up for a while. Muppet bird. Also, if it made that noise to start with, I would have known it was a chicken.</p>\n\n    <p>Meanwhile, as we watched Lost, a small lizard emerged from goodness knows where and turned the ceiling into its own personal playground. It was clearly having a lovely time so we let it be, figuring if it got in, it could let itself out when it wanted to.</p>\n\n    <p>It was completely dark when we emerged again, nightfall doing what it says on the tin in these parts and properly falling suddenly upon you. None of this gently fading in nonsense. We crossed back to the lodge for dinner and ended up order the same dishes again: Pete’s chicken in sweet sauce, spicy fried noodles for me and some fries to share. I tried to order my own plate to avoid this but Pete was having none of it, and then had a little strop when I took a chip that he deemed to be on his side of the plate.</p>\n\n    <p>This is why sharing food is a BAD IDEA PEOPLE.</p>\n\n    <p>We enjoyed it very much - Pete in particular had been looking forward to ordering that dish again for a couple of days - and we managed to get rid of some annoying bits of change when we paid. Score!</p>\n\n    <p>Back in our room, we settled down for our now classic evening routine: I dug into the stash of creamer sachets that I’d been collecting from various rooms we stayed in because Mike just isn’t a thing here, (current count: 2. We were running low) and we popped the kettle on, confident in the knowledge that in 45 minutes to an hour, we’d be brewing up (it’s a slow, tiny kettle). And thus the evening’s itinerary could commence: Lost, a cup of tea and then a more lighthearted episode of modern family to finish with.</p>\n\n    <p>It was lovely to settle down into proper beds for the night and we finally switched out the light on our last night in Bukit Lawang.</p>\n</section>",

Pete complained about this as he didn’t think we should have to get up until 7:45. I disagreed, reasoning that we had to shower, go for breakfast, pack up the final few bits for our trek, check out and put our bags in storage so that we were ready for nine.</p>\n\n    <p>Consequently, I was obliged to go and have the first shower - again - while Pete remained curled up under the covers to “guard the bed”.</p>\n\n    <p>This his all-time top saying which means he doesn’t want to get up and I can basically lip-sync along with this now when he says it.</p>\n\n    <p>To his credit, the bed has never been stolen under his watch, but equally I have never found this to be a particularly likely proposition.</p>\n\n    <p>One we were both ready and I had bemoaned the three new bites on my foot, we ambled over for breakfast and picked the “toast scrambled egg” off the menu. This turned out to be more of a scrambled egg sandwich but it was also somehow unutterably delicious and while I have no idea what they did to it to make it so fabulous, I scarfed it down extremely rapidly. YUM!</p>\n\n    <p>We topped up our water and returned to our rooms to pack our final few things and ready our backpacks to be left with the lodge while we were trekking. It seemed that we had to pay to leave our bags behind, but better than lugging them with us I suppose!</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52238709397_d1787f9219_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240152620_7a8b99999f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Our guide was ready and waiting, our water bottles were full, and after a quick setting-off photo, we began our trek.</p>\n\n    <p>We actually had two guides: the second was the son of the guy in charge and he tended to bring up the rear, carrying some of the supplies. We crossed the river and struck out into jungle territory, crossing first through a rubber plantation where the trees were tapped and dripping their sap into little bowls. We actually passed two men hauling their rubber crop to the market, the lumpy mass swinging from a pole which stretched between them.</p>\n\n    <p>It was 16 minutes in when we got to see our first orangutan. Pretty impressive work from our guide already! This was a juvenile, aged around 5, and he was sat up in a tree snacking on rubber fruit; apparently orangutans like the seed inside. We were told that his mother would almost certainly be in the vicinity as orangutans don’t mature and become independent until they are seven or eight.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double \">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239661746_6bb97e0075_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239661546_7b87662c2a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Moving on, we entered the jungle proper, occasionally encountering other trekkers and swapping information about where to find the jungle’s most famous residents.</p>\n\n    <p>The jungle was a constant shift and slide of challenges to be negotiated. The only consistent thing about the going underfoot was that it was never flat: we were either climbing steeply upwards or slithering steeply downwards. Roots crossed the paths constantly, trees and vines erupted from the earth everywhere competing for canopy light and the loops and twists of curly-fry hanging branches and air roots made for pretty promising band holds. Often vital when heaving our selves up stepped roots around a tree, climbing over rocks or trying not to slip and slide down muddy inclines. And it was muddy, when it wasn’t stony or leaf-strewn: very red mud that was occasionally slick with recent rain. This stood out in sharp contrast to the brilliant, vibrant green form the almost audibly growing rainforest.</p>\n\n    <p>It was noisy too, in the way that nature often is in the background, but once you tune in to it, you can’t help but here the cacophony of life. Cicadas buzzing and droning, gibbons hooting to each other in little song-like whoops, the rustle and sway of huge leaves and the occasional crash as something makes it’s way through the canopy or undergrowth. We heard the squawks of hornbills, the occasional rush of the river and myriad other sounds that were unknown to us. It was a magic all of its own.</p>\n\n    <p>While the going was challenging in places, we got to see some wonderful sights. First you was a white faced gibbon, responsible for the little cooing calls we could hear. They were furry and inquisitive, staying up in the canopy but looking down at us as a couple more appeared: our guide told us they stay in groups of 4 or 5 and their calls are to alert other groups to their territory. They guard this fiercely from other gibbons and will fight for it, but are happy to share with other monkeys.</p>\n\n    <p>After a couple of hours or so, we were tiring a little. The temperature wasn’t crazy hot as there was cloud cover and we were under the trees. But the humidity was intense and we were sweating buckets. And thus it was time for a fruit break!</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240152705_c0439ecdb1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239946774_831d8ed19e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The guides cracked into their bags and produced a veritable feast, covering the ground with a couple of ferns and laying out bananas, lychees, oranges, pineapple, strawberries and passionfruit. It was all wonderful and I think we both demolished our 5 a day in about 5 minutes. YUM! After we’d scorched through around 5 passionfruit, our guide said people in Indonesia by and large weren’t keen on them. Funny: there a favourite for both me and Pete and we almost never have them as they’re so expensive.</p>\n\n    <p>Moving on, we encountered another orangutan, this time a mother with a one-year-old baby. The mum was very much chilling out and relaxing up in the trees, immense arms stretched to keep her stable, while her infant buzzed about practising her climbing, sometimes on branches and sometimes on her mother. In fact, the mother’s face had a very put-upon expression but she tolerated the excessive energy of her offspring.</p>\n\n    <p>Orangutans tend not to have more than one infant at once because they are quite the handful, and as they’re solitary creatures, they don’t get much child support. Tough gig.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239661711_4e2320d78d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240152735_e86a6b0831_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The next creature we spied had no qualms whatsoever about making her presence felt; a monkey (I’m not sure what kind) sat in the fork of a tree as we topped a little rise and encountered another tour group having their fruit break. (They had watermelon - suckers!) The monkey was peering dolefully at them, alternating between making little mooing noises and pouting, duck-face fashion, with her hands up. We weren’t sure what that meant but it was extremely comical and expressive nonetheless.</p>\n\n    <p>We stopped for lunch around 1:15, plopping down on the massive trunk of a fallen tree on the top of a ridgeway through the jungle. Some time back there had been a landslide down one side of the ridge and we could see down the valley to the jungle on the other side, the gap already being filled with saplings making a bid for the sky.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240165635_ddcd24b0e2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52238697347_63914c8808_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>This afforded us top views while we tucked into little pre-wrapped parcels of egg and fried rice (nasi goreng). To these were added prawn crackers, cucumber and tomato (Pete ate my tomato though, thanks Pete) and we scarfed our lunch down with gusto: it was delicious.</p>\n\n    <p>The rest of the morning’s pineapple had been sliced up and laid out too, but while we ate our rice, hoards of ants and flies decided they fancied some sweet fruit and even a large butterfly landed delicately in order to partake.</p>\n\n    <p>Our second guide eventually noticed the dinner party going on and to be fair, he did pick off most of the ants before handing us the fruit. I only had one extra to pluck away.</p>\n\n    <p>After lunch, we were entertained by more gibbons performing acrobatics through the trees above and also by a series of ants who came to claim bits of dropped rice. It took two ants to carry a single grain (one at the front, one at the back, Chuckle Brothers style) and they marched it solemnly along the fallen tree to goodness knows where. Clearly the colony would have having a take away that evening.</p>\n\n    <p>As we were gazing out over the jungle, we heard more of the hornbill calls and our guide suddenly pointed to the bird perched in a tree. As the tree was growing further down the valley, we could actually see the bird below us, despite the height of its perch off the ground. It was big - much bigger than I’d imagined - and I was surprised by just how bright and prominent it’s beak was. Clue’s in the name, I guess. Our guide told us this was a rhino hornbill, one of six kinds who live in the jungle, and that they were often tricky to spot.</p>\n\n    <p>This one took off in big clatter of wings; it didn’t seem to be a particularly graceful flyer, but it allowed us to see the brightly coloured beak and the flash of white on the black tail. A second hornbill unexpectedly flapped after it a couple of moments later so we got to see the spectacle twice.</p>\n\n    <p>There were also loads of plants to admire as we tramped further along our way. There were loads of beautiful, twisted, unnamed vines and trees, and speaking of trees, there were a number of enormous specimens with giant, buttress roots taller than we were. We came across a ficus or strangler fig, having cloaked its victim tree in long, slender roots creating a knotted, impenetrable cage, and we passed coffee plants with berries green and red.</p>\n\n    <p>Our guide also found a quinine tree - he carved a small piece of bark for us to try chewing and sure enough, it tasted grim: incredibly bitter, reminding me why I’m not a gin and tonic fan, and it left a taste in my mouth a bit like paracetamol.</p>\n\n    <p>We had one final orangutan encounter, another mother and baby, hanging out above us. Again, the little one was full of beans while the mother slumped in the way only an orangutan can, keeping an eye on her energetic charge. It was fascinating to watch her when she did move: it was so effortless and muscular but also soft with her flowing red hair. She could use her feet as effectively as her hands to grip the branches and it seemed as little effort to her to hang by one arm as it did to sit perched in the nook of a tree trunk. Orangutans live a solitary existence - their lifespan being roughly 40-45 years - and for most of that time, it seems they quite like to chill. Staying mostly in the canopy for safety, they build a new, leafy next most days to snooze in, needed about 7-8 hours a night kike humans. And after all, they are our 4th closest neighbour, genetically speaking. Our guide told us they also sometimes build day nests if they want to stay somewhere and chill for a bit.</p>\n\n    <p>While in general, orangutan numbers are sadly in decline, the National park is clearly having a positive impact as their numbers are slightly on the increase. The orangutans are protected from encroaching farming and plantations and tourism seems to ensure that locals can still gain an income from their local area while maintaining conservation practices.</p>\n\n    <p>We descended the final hill down to the river, grabbing on to tree trunks for dear life in my case, and then we traded our boots for flip flops for the last few minutes as we had to wade across the water in a couple of places. It was deliciously cool on my aching feet and Pete and I were keen for a bit of a swim.</p>\n\n    <p>We came to the little shelter beside the stream where we’d be putting up for the night, and inside the bamboo and canvas structure, a couple of camping mattresses had been laid out under a mosquito net.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240165650_240e71f8b1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239977059_e987a26943_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Thank goodness: having managed to avoid bites mostly for the first two weeks of our trip, I was now plastered in them: there were up and down my legs and on my feet, they itched like crazy and I was pretty sure they were from the night before. Which is unfair because I wore a long skirt and lots of mosquito repellant.</p>\n\n    <p>Yet another brand to add to the “bug spray that doesn’t work” column. Rude.</p>\n\n    <p>To be fair, I don’t think any of them work. I seems to get eaten alive no matter what I do. Even through my clothes.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete and I changed into our swimmers and paddled a little way upstream in search of slightly deeper water. The stream flowed quite slowly and was barely more than knee-deep but we found the deepest patch we could and settled down on smooth, wide stones under the water so that we were at least in the water up to our waists. If we leaned back, we could be mostly submerged!</p>\n\n    <p>It was blissful to soak my aching feet and stinging, overheated bites in the cold water and once we’d adjusted to the temperature, we just sat and chatted, listening to the noises of the jungle, watching the swaying trees and spotting tiny fish swimming through the crystal clear water flows.</p>\n\n    <p>We spotted a tiny rodent-like creature trot across a branch over the river and after a while, monkey came strolling down the rocks which lined the river bank.</p>\n\n    <p>A second one followed and suddenly I didn’t think it looked quite so cute and friendly.</p>\n\n    <p>I hopped out of the water sharpish and onto the opposite bank hoping it would go away, but while the second one did climb a tree and head back into the forest, the first one kept its eyes trained on us as it walked further along the bank.</p>\n\n    <p>Suddenly it was across the river and running towards us, teeth bared: we yelled and I screeched as loud as I could to frighten it and while it stopped it was still close. It got bolder and we yelled some more: I stumbled over my flip flops and fell - idiot - but Pete had the presence of mind to throw a rock at it, which finally convinced it to back off.</p>\n\n    <p>It wasn’t massive, but it still had more teeth and claws than we did and I didn’t fancy seeing who would come off best in contest.</p>\n\n    <p>I was a bit shaken and I’d managed to cut the underside of my food and scrape my knee. Our guides appeared around the bed in the river and threw things at the monkeys until they had well and truly cleared off and we pottered back to camp.</p>\n\n    <p>I got back in the river quickly to wash the blood off my legs and I think Pete would happily have swam for longer as he’s much braver than me, but our guides had prepared tea and snacks and I figured I may as well have it while it was hot.</p>\n\n    <p>I wrapped my towel around me and sat on a mat by the river, while Pete changed and came to join me.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239959784_10df2a122a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239674221_fb263dc607_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The food laid before us was an interesting mix. The tea was self-explanatory, but we also had some fritters which the guide said were sweet potato but which I think were something similar to but not quite the same as sweet potato. More like cassava? Whatever they were, they were delicious, lightly battered and served with onions which is all well and good by me.</p>\n\n    <p>We also had some crackers sprinkled with sugar and a cut up lime. We weren’t sure what this was for so in the end, we squeezed it onto the crackers. This actually worked a treat and was reminiscent of lemon and sugar on pancakes, but as Pete pointed out, maybe the lime was for the tea. Perhaps the guides would come around to our shelter and wonder what on Earth we were doing with the lime. Possible.</p>\n\n    <p>It was still early, maybe half four or five, and we had time to kill, so I worked on my journal and a Pete read a bit. It was a little bit uncomfortable sat on the floor after a while, so Pete went to lie on the mattresses while I stayed out and drank more tea, obvs.</p>\n\n    <p>But I wished I had joined Pete as suddenly, a guide behind me yelled, there was a skitter and a crash and a monkey dashed past me, having made a break for the leftover crackers. I shrieked and jumped in surprise, hopping to my feet, but the money was off and again, the guides did all they could to persuade it not to return.</p>\n\n    <p>I very much hoped that they didn’t prove nocturnal as there was all sorts of mischief they could get up to in the night.</p>\n\n    <p>I decided to join Pete in the shelter after all.</p>\n\n    <p>I finished my journal and looked up outside the shelter and suddenly spotted a monitor lizard strolling by. I roused Pete and we hopped over to the water, but it didn’t seem keen to have the company and slipped into the stream with its funny waddling gate and glided along with the current. It was still lovely to see though.</p>\n\n    <p>In other news, monkeys continued to plague our camp; our guide kept up the occasional rock chuck in their direction and told us that it was a big, aggressive male and that they’re often after food. He suggested trying to act big and not be afraid but given that I was afraid and that hollering at the offending beast had yielded no results, I didn’t fancy my chances.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, when I went for a jungle wee, I took Pete with me to keep watch and potentially be ready to throw ALL the rocks.</p>\n\n    <p>We read for a bit in the shelter, taking advantage of the mosquito netting and dark descended rapidly as it always seems to here. After a while, our guides called to use that dinner was ready, and on a groundsheet outside out tent, they had laid out a pair of candles and a veritable feast of treats to enjoy. Plus a big bottle of water each which was very welcome.</p>\n\n    <p>We all ate together, passing round plates of rice and then adding to it from the dishes before us. There was tofu in a sticky sauce (yum), chicken rendang (double yum), vegetables in a curry sauce, potato cakes and fried tempeh (double yum as well), prawn crackers and crispy noodles. Far more than we could eat but we tucked in with gusto to clear what we could. And very tasty it was too!</p>\n\n    <p>We chatted with our guide for a bit and he answered the questions we peppered him with about the vast array of different languages, cultures, customs and religions that make up Indonesia. As a dispersed country, different islands have quite distinct identities but even within islands, there are vast differences. Our guide said that, for example, he couldn’t understand the language of the people who lived at Lake Toba, in the centre of the island. However, he did say that overall, Indonesia is very accepting of a wide diversity of practices, opinions and customs and that at the end of the day, everyone is Indonesian. It was a lovely sentiment.</p>\n\n    <p>After dinner we had a big flask of ginger tea sweetened with sugar (very tasty indeed) and bit plate of peanuts in their shells to pop open and consume. We managed to get through the whole meal without any monkey attacks (score!) and even though a leaf fell on my at one point and I assumed a giant big had ambushed me, we remained relatively unscathed for the rest of the evening.</p>\n\n    <p>I did swallow a moth though. By mistake when it flew into my face, attracted by my head torch.</p>\n\n    <p>It was absolutely pitch dark, we couldn’t even see the river a few feet away and stars speckled the areas of sky that weren’t hidden behind the leafy outstretched arms of the trees. We slipped back into our mosquito net to read and even though it was barely half past eight, we felt a little sleepy.</p>\n\n    <p>Eventually we decided to call it a night, ventured out into the dark jungle to clean our teeth and do a final loo run and then settled back under our mosquito net. Ten pm and all’s well.</p>\n\n    <h1>Day 16</h1>\n\n    <p>I woke at around half seven but Pete stayed obstinately asleep so I read quietly, leaving him to it. While we’d had a long night’s sleep in terms of hours, we’d both woken up a number of times feeling a bit stiff on the hard rocks; the floor mattresses helped a lot but they were thin and not completely forgiving.</p>\n\n    <p>My bites itched like nobody’s business.</p>\n\n    <p>Around 8:15, I crawled out of the netting and started gathering a few of my things. We’d hung up our sweat-damp clothes following the previous day’s trek and they were, of course, exactly as damp as they had been the night before thanks to the still, moisture-saturated air.</p>\n\n    <p>Not to worry! I figured they’d soon be damp again anyway once we started walking. As I rustled about, Pete emerged properly from his sleep and we both got ready for breakfast.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52238697402_6fbb18725a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240165630_23742a9ea9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Stepping out of our shelter, we sat on the mats by the river and our guides brought round some breakfast. First came tea and biscuits (they clearly knew their audience) and this was followed by a huge fruit plate each which, yes, OK, had some watermelon, but also had mandarin, passionfruit, lychee and pineapple which more than made up for it. Yum! And once again: got our fruit quota in. We were starting to think that our jungle adventure would be the time on the trip when we ate the most nutritious food!</p>\n\n    <p>And it turned out the like we had been given the previous day was definitely to add to the tea and not the biscuits. I added some to my tea and regretted it. Better without.</p>\n\n    <p>We watched what looked like a chipmunk scamper through the trees and a dragonfly hum down gently onto a twig over the water. It was very peaceful. I snacked on a couple of biscuits while I finished cup of tea number three (or four?) and had just grabbed another when another plate of food appeared: a triple layer sandwich with 4 slices of bread, an omelette-style egg in the bottom, salad in the middle and a slice of cheese in the top.</p>\n\n    <p>It was filling to say the least - and tasty - and instead of feeling like going trekking, it felt like it was time to lie down. Although just as I was finishing my last couple of bites, one of the monkeys from the previous night crossed the river and approached us. I hastily jumped up swallowing the end of my sandwich and some more rock throwing commenced.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete, thankfully, guarded me while I went for a jungle loo.</p>\n\n    <p>We set off on our day’s trek around ten with roughly six hours of hiking ahead of us. The first part of our route however, took us upriver. And by upriver, I suppose I mean mostly inriver. We had to wear our flip flops and splash through the flow of water, skipping over stones and occasionally scaling the sandy root systems of the bank. My flip flops are like a thousand percent not made for this and I slipped and slid and was the definitive unhappy bunny as I banged my feet on rocks, pebbles dragged through the soles and I lost all sense of grip both between me and my wretched flip flops as well as between the flip flops and the ground. I was pathetically slow but with dogged plodding, we eventually reached a point where the river deepened and forked, flowing from two tributaries.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a little rest here as even though we hadn’t been going for very long, it was the point where we could finally don our shoes and commence actual walking. Properly shod. Lush.</p>\n\n    <p>However, it was nice having a little rest and soaking my poor abused feet in the cold water, soothing away the aches.</p>\n\n    <p>When it was time to move on, our guide jerked his chin up on of the tributaries and said we were going up there, so we dried off our feet, slid them into the luxurious comfort of supportive, enclosed walking boots and prepared to go.</p>\n\n    <p>Except I was wrong. He hadn’t gestured upstream. Instead he’d gestured at what looked to me like the cliff face separating the two forks of the river. We were climbing up there.</p>\n\n    <p>I will as I’d to exaggerating a little, but not but much. The fact that I hadn’t even seen the path because it seemed so absurd to be scaling such a steep mudbank says it all really. But scale it we did, using our hands to pull ourselves up on rocks and tree roots. We were panting for breath and covered in sweat but we kept on climbing and gradually, the gradient evened out,</p>\n\n    <p>Actually, that’s a lie too: it didn’t really even put, it more sort of became just like a normal steep climb that you don’t need to use your hands for, we jungle types are pretty hardy and that practically counts as flat to us.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239686361_633bb4a765_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239686706_b11f111d32_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>The rest of the hike followed roughly the same pattern of the previous day: ups and downs, through jungle thickets and around tangled trees, pausing for our morning fruit break (taking us up to or 46 a day) and hunting for animals to spot going about their daily business. The morning was fairly quiet on that point. Unless you count the ants. The jungle is crawling with them, naturally, and they’re always so busy, from the tiny ones which constantly march and swarm in huge crowds to the big, hulking ones, the size of my little finger, who always seem to be alone. Lots of brightly coloured butterflies fluttered lazily around and the chirrups of the cicadas were a constant presence.</p>\n\n    <p>However, as the day wore on we had more luck, first catching sight of some more white-faced gibbons far off in the canopy, and then, a little further along as we’d started a slightly tricky descent, our guide spotted a little group of black gibbons. They aren’t as common and as it happened, we were able to follow them for a quite while, watching them swing their dark, furry little bodies through the trees, hang effortlessly by one hand to grab snacks with their feet and eat and every so often, peer down at us on the floor below.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240177545_01820d348a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239971769_2f021477ab_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We reached a small stream at the bottom of the incline and as we stepped onto stones to cross it, we found 3 or 4 of the black gibbons poised in trees overhanging the water, watching our passage. Our guide said we had been going to have lunch here but that the food would attract the gibbons and we we’d have to wait for them to go away. Apparently they can get aggressive.</p>\n\n    <p>While we waited by the stream, we spotted a little turtle having a swim. It was surprisingly well camouflaged against the stones at the bottom of the shallow water. It was also unbelievably adorable with a reddish head and neck and a very pointed snout. Our guide sprinkled sand over the surface of the water and the little turtle swam after it, thinking the small plops of sand were insects.</p>\n\n    <p>After a few moments, a smaller one shot out from underneath a rock and it was kind of awesome to see mother and baby.</p>\n\n    <p>In the end, our guide suggested we walk for a bit along the stream, rounding a few bends to ensure we’d put some distance between ourselves and the gibbons, and then have lunch. This we did with reasonable success and we were tucking in to fried vegetable noodles, egg, prawn crackers and some tomato with some gusto when another monkey appeared. Our guide pondered it over his food and told us it wasn’t one that would be bothered about us rustling papers or getting things from our packs so we could carry on eating.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52238709347_731875fe07_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239695443_5a85fab4d1_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>We kept a steady eye on each other, humans and monkey, as it came closer and closer, shimmying half way down the nearest tree to get a better look at what we were doing. It had a fluffy, black and white face, it’s fur ringing it’s eyes giving it a slightly surprised, inquisitive look. It had very soft looking grey fur, a long silky tail and a fluffy white tummy. Pete commented that he would like to give the monkey belly wubs and he was on to a pretty good thing. It had the look of a super cuddly creature.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course, looks can be deceiving, and our watchful visitor seized its moments, dashed to the picnic spot and grabbed a lunch bag with chicken in it and made off again.</p>\n\n    <p>Not very far though: it was cocky enough to sit just up on the bank of stream, not even bothering to climb a tree as it opened the bag and pulled out the pieces of chicken inside. It discarded the bag (although don’t worry, we carried it away with us).</p>\n\n    <p>We spent the rest of our meal watching each other until it was time for us to hike onwards. There was an hour or so further to go until we reached our camp for the night which basically involved climbing up and over the next ridge.</p>\n\n    <p>So on we marched, hauling ourselves up, sweating profusely and climbing through the vegetation and the sticky air. We each carry a little face towel gifted to us by our friends Maja and Maciek, but mopping the sweat off our faces just seems to make way for even more.</p>\n\n    <p>It does prevent it from dripping in your eyes though.</p>\n\n    <p>The last section of the hike was a very steep down, and our guide warned us to concentrate and go carefully. He wasn’t wrong: we were obliged to cling to roots and fallen trees to make big steps down: one good thing about the jungle is that it tends to give you plenty of things to hold on to, and most of it doesn’t bite. We just had to keep an eye out for things with spikes or things crawling with insects.</p>\n\n    <p>We came to one section which practically required you abseil down a steep mudbank, holding a rope and a selection of roots in order to keep your feet on the face of the incline. We had to pause here as we’d caught up with another group of trekkers and the slope was giving them some problems.</p>\n\n    <p>Mostly so was just glad there wasn’t also a waterfall flowing down over the hand-holds.</p>\n\n    <p>We reached the bottom without incident coming out next to the main river. This was a much larger affair than any we’d come across on the rest of the trek and had a reasonable current. There was decent shore made of rocks and boulders and we hopped over these past a number of camps, eventually leaving them behind. Apparently we were going further.</p>\n\n    <p>To get to our camp, we had to cross the river. Our guide said the river wasn’t very deep and the current was OK, but the going was quite slippery underfoot. And therefore Pete and I And all our belongings were loaded into a large rubber ring and towed across. Luxury!</p>\n\n    <p>Climbing the opposite bank, we found our camp and clambered up to our shelter for the night. We dropped our bags inside and changed into our swim things, returning to the river for a soak.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52238732952_f23e20422b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52238714162_4ebd75cc2e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Again, the icy water felt blissful as we were hot and sweaty, sticky with bug spray and jungle dirt and my insect bites were hit to the touch and itched. Sliding into the water was just what we needed, and even the initial bite of the cold was welcome. Pete was straight into the current, swimming with it downstream before turning and swimming back up again with a side eddy. I perched on an underwater rock for a bit and watched before joining him for a couple of rounds with the current.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double \">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239707231_9c0a8d95f2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239691966_4997494865_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Our guide called that our tea was ready and so we hauled out of the river for a bit and put away a jug of our usual, alongside some more sweet crackers and lime. I don’t care if that’s not what the lime is for: it tastes great. We were also brought some more sweet potato fritters, pipping hot and crispy. YUM.</p>\n\n    <p>As we were getting back into the river for another swim, a few raindrops started pattering down. The second swim didn’t have the same pull for me as I was no longer blisteringly hot and sticky, so after giving my legs another quick soak, I decided to get out of the water and get dressed. The guides had kindly rescued our towels and put them under a canvas shelter and so I gathered them up and climbed into my evening clothes.</p>\n\n</section>\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239700568_f94d967ea0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239700553_78094d896d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n</div>\n<section>\n\n    <p>Pete had a good rainy swim but when other trekkers appeared who would be sharing our camp, and a family of four started swimming and splashing around his rock (rude!) he called it quits too.</p>\n\n    <p>As we got dressed in our shelter, the rain foot harder and harder, thundering down without the faintest sign of let up. I wrote my journal in the half-light under the mosquito netting as the clouds dimmed the sunlight. It made an almighty racket on the canvas.</p>\n\n    <p>All in all, it rained pretty solidly for a couple of hours as outside the shelter, the world got darker, fading through grey and finally to inky black. Our guides came to call us for inner in a shelter down by the banks of the river that was not swollen and roaring with rain water. We tucked into another enormous feast, this time featuring sweet potato sambal, a pumpkin and vegetable curry and chicken alongside the rice, prawn crackers, potato cakes and tempeh that we’d eaten the night before. Moths and flies were attracted to the light in the shelter, buffeting themselves about and we all perched on roll mats over the floor and chatted while we ate.</p>\n\n    <p>It was perhaps half eight when Pete and I returned to our shelter. Jungle evenings are a little bit funny: it’s pitch black and there’s not much to do per se, other than read and even that’s a little bit awkward because you need to be sat on the floor and there’s not really anything to lean on. I settled for sprawling under the mosquito netting, mentally cursing my bites and our useless bug spray, chatting quietly with Pete and finally, reading. We had an early night, turning out for one last, somewhat drizzly visit to the completely dark jungle loo - there’s actually a designated spot behind a tarp in this camp - and then we settled down to catch some sleep around ten. I very much hoped that our exertions from the day would enable us to sleep soundly and long, but I was also prepared to take sweet dreams of an actual shower on the morrow.</p>\n</section>",

A bit of a mixed bag overall: I opted for fried noodles and egg which was nice except the egg was stone cold and a bit rubbery. Pete’s experience was similar, but we filled up with some extra prawn crackers and treats from the pastry table so no harm done. We could also have lived without the graphic surgical procedure that was being screened on the TVs dotted around the dining room. Like, if you just have a TV at all times, maybe change the channel?</p>\n\n    <p>Back in our rooms, we made a tea, polished off the last of the biscuits I’d nicked from breakfast and the donut Pete had swiped and then packed up our bags. We’d been leaving it as late as possible thanks to the damp state of our gear from the previous day. Once we were ready, we did a sweep to swipe the loo roll and headed down to reception. We paid our laundry bill which came to a little under £3 making us wish we’d thrown in some more items, got our flight itinerary printed out (we’ve been caught out by this before at airports who then made us pay £25 a pop to have tickets printed out) and hunted for more loo roll. Success was found in perforated papery form in the lobby toilets and we collected big, before sitting down to wait for our ride.</p>\n\n    <p>Sitting down in the lobby, not the loo.</p>\n\n    <p>The our free airport transfer turned up early and so we were soon on our way. The drive took about 20 minutes and took us away from the city instead of on our usual route through it. We drove through what was definitely the Kensington and Chelsea equivalent of Malang where massive, decorative mansions lined the streets with ostentatious columns and pillars and turrets behind tall, gleaming gates. Once we arrived, we tipped our driver and headed into the airport.</p>\n\n    <p>I will confess to being a slightly paranoid airport arriver and I would rather be super early than play fast and loose with the boarding time. Consequently, we found at at 10:10, the desks were checking in the 10:45 flight people and were nowhere near getting to our 12:30 flight.</p>\n\n    <p>A helpful chap at the desk sorted us out anyway, checked our bags through Jakarta to arrive for us to collect in Medan and we moseyed on through to the waiting area with a couple of hours to wait before our flight. I very much hoped it was going to go on time as we only had an hour’s transfer window.</p>\n\n    <p>The airport had significantly better wifi than the hotel so I spent most of the time editing and uploading photos, and trying not to think about the fact that as 12:30 rolled around, they hadn’t even called our flight to board. Our only hope was that everything would run late.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52230829635_479c9df92f_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Our flight was finally called half an hour after take off - classic - but it was still another half an hour after that before we left. An hour late. Our entire transfer window.</p>\n\n    <p>Goody gumdrops.</p>\n\n    <p>The flight passed smoothly enough, and even though it was only an hour and a half or so, they brought everyone a small pot of water (I accidentally exploded mine) and a bread roll filled with coffee-flavoured paste. Not bad, but I don’t like coffee so meh.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52230829630_ec2f62e478_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We landed in Jakarta just after three, silently screaming at the slow hoards taking their time shuffling their hand luggage about so we could get of the plane and look for our next flight. It didn’t really matter how fast we ran though: we’d already missed it.</p>\n\n    <p>However, examining our tickets, we found we’d been re-booked already on a flight an hour later which was awesome. I just wish we’d been told this earlier as it would have saved a lot of hassle.</p>\n\n    <p>We skipped through security, grabbed a bottle of water each - I guzzled mine down as I always seem to need extra - and we sat down to wait the half hour until our flight to Medan.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course boarding time came and went and at the supposed take-off time, a scuffle of movement near the desk alerted us to the fact that it was time to board.</p>\n\n    <p>Except no, no it wasn’t. Big crowds of people, us included, were sent off to a different gate instead. We hot-footed it through the airport, arrived at the gate and waved our tickets, well aware that we were after the close of gate time. But the staff didn’t seem unduly worried by details like schedules or tickets or the time and simply gestured for us to wait.</p>\n\n    <p>The logical part of me understands that every culture is different, time is a human construct you just have to roll with it when you’re in another country, embracing the local way of doing things.</p>\n\n    <p>Every other part of me was mentally screeching HOW DO YOU EVER GET ANYTHING DONE EVER WITHOUT A COLOSSAL WASTE OF EVERYONE’S TIME AND ENERGY.</p>\n\n    <p>But I’m British so I kept it bottled and Pete and I waited quietly as instructed, tutting to one another occasionally (out loud!) and commiserating with a German family who found themselves in the same frustrating position.</p>\n\n    <p>Time ticked on and the staff boarded passengers for a plane to Bali. Then they announced our plane and we all sort of tumbled together into the same tube. How were we meant to know which plane to get on?</p>\n\n    <p>We ambled across the tarmac in the late afternoon sun, and managed to get on our plane around half four. Pete commented that he wasn’t going to fly with Indonesia any more (he’d evidently forgotten that last time we tried this, we had been delayed every single time and once for so many hours that the airline were obliged to provide us all with food).</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, Pete did come up with an excellent contribution for the day’s journal when he noted that it’s all well and good going off the beaten track, but the thing about the beaten track is that the track is beaten. Which just simplifies everything really.</p>\n\n    <p>Apropos of nothing, can we also just take a second to appreciate the identikit immaculate beehive hairstyle sported by every member of the cabin crew for Air Batik? Kind of mind blowing.</p>\n\n    <p>I settled down into my seat, completed an on- board sudoku as we took off and then pulled out my iPad to watch a film. The flight was pretty turbulent which kept knocking the bottom out of my stomach. I was watching Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets and to feel the plane lurching as Harry and Ron flew the Ford Anglia to Hogwarts and crashed into the whomping willow was a level of immersion I could have lived without.</p>\n\n    <p>We were given a warm cheesy roll and a mocha muffin as a snack and another small cup of water so that helped to pass a bit of time.</p>\n\n    <p>I was glad when we landed and could just leave the plane behind, shimmying round to grab our luggage and watching the live stream of the baggage handlers sticking the luggage onto the conveyor belt behind the curtain. Amusing.</p>\n\n    <p>I had been half convinced that what with all the plane shenanigans our luggage wouldn’t make it, but sure enough it turned up and we schlepped out of the airport to find a taxi. This was the usual round of subduing hecklers, finding our way, arguing with drivers and staff and eventually settling on an option at random because really, in these situations, what choice do you really have but to decide to trust someone? I showed our hotel address to the driver, and after a short consultation with 5 other drivers, they all eventually concluded that we wanted to go to hotel Sentika.</p>\n\n    <p>Which is what it said on the paper I showed him but which didn’t seem to register. We’re never quite sure why, but as long as the driver knew where we were going, it was all good with us.</p>\n\n    <p>No sooner had we pulled out of the airport than an almighty storm started flinging itself around in the general vicinity: heavy rain poured down, doing battle with the taxi’s wipers, and forks of lightning split the dark night sky every few seconds. It was dramatic and intense.</p>\n\n    <p>Or at least I thought it was intense until we drove into a flash flood. Now that was intense. It was hard to tell how high the water was but looking at the vehicle in front, the flood came at least as high as the wheels. People riding motorbikes held their legs out, flip-flops dangling as they urged their machines through the water. The engine of the taxi whined and groaned as the taxi driver argued back with it out loud in a language we didn’t understand. What had been a street was suddenly a river and cars were beeping, rain was coming down and we were cocooned in our little tin box waiting to see what would happen next.</p>\n\n    <p>Well, nothing really happened next. The driver coaxed the car along, occasionally bumping into underwater pavements and obstacles, until we drove out of the flood and normal service resumed. Just like that.</p>\n\n    <p>I say normal service: I did think the taxi driver was giving us a bit of a runaround as the route we took wasn’t super direct and he stopped twice to get out of the car and sort something out while the meter was running. However, we did indeed make it to our hotel and the rain had pretty much given up by that point so we hauled our bags inside and staggered up to reception,</p>\n\n    <p>We checked in, dumped our stuff and set out to find the nearest Indomart. We both felt tired, we had arrived a good couple of hours later than planned and neither of us felt like we had the energy to go out for dinner. So Indomart provided and we had spicy noodles and crisps in our room, alongside a cup of tea with real milk.</p>\n\n    <p>And a couple of biscuits.</p>\n\n    <p>Snuggling down to watch Lost in bed, I felt pretty sleepy but also relieved to have got to the end of our journey. Made it!</p>\n\n    <h1>Day 14</h1>\n\n    <p>We got up around half eight, showered and went to investigate the hotel breakfast. Jackpot! It was a huge buffet and so we located a table and entered attack mode.</p>\n\n    <p>The dining room was busy: the hotel was a large convention centre in the centre of Medan and while we hadn’t really taken it in before, it seemed to be a pretty fancy one. I love when that works out as we just tend to pick something that’s in roughly the right place and within our budget (under it where possible) of £40. So when you end up in a 4 star jobby with an epic breakfast spread, you darn tooting make the most of it!</p>\n\n    <p>I went with my now traditional mie goreng (stir fried noodles with veg and chilli) and 2 eggs Sunny up which were cooked on the raw side of runny but never mind. I also grabbed a side of prawn cracker because I love that here you can have crisps for breakfast and it’s not being childish, it’s just the norm. Yay crisps! I also had some star shaped cereal to which I added some raisins and chopped nuts because it seemed like a good idea. Pete went for a general pick and mix across everything and managed to locate the fruit buffet which I’d somehow missed.</p>\n\n    <p>So when I went back for my daily breakfast cake (a donut on this occasion) I also hunted this out. Well that proved to be a treat! There were the usual platters of disappointment fruit (watermelon) and melon and so forth, the very welcome platters of pineapple (lush) but also a fruit salad station with a variety of fruits in jars. I pulled out a bowl and went to town, topping it off with a slice of starfruit, partly because I wanted to see what it tasted like, and mostly for the aesthetic. I took Pete a slice too.</p>\n\n    <p>Back at the table, I investigated my fruity spoils with glee. Starfruit we have a ten out of ten for looks but a 2 for taste. Not unpleasant, just didn’t really taste of much, and so finished off Pete’s. I mean, it was better than watermelon, but then that’s a very low bar.</p>\n\n    <p>I also had in my bowl some snake fruit (yum!) some strawberries that taste like they’d been infused with cloves (unnecessary as strawberries taste amazing and need no seasoning to support their favour of sweet happiness) and pineapple in chilli syrup.</p>\n\n    <p>The latter was a win! The chilli was an amazing complement to the slightly sour zing of the pineapple. Must try this at home.</p>\n\n    <p>Buffet well and truly demolished, we returned our our rooms, had a last cuppa and packed up our things. We checked out and found our driver waiting for us in the lobby - he had a sign with our names on which always makes me smile! - and we wiggled on out to the car ready to make the journey to Bukit Lawang.</p>\n\n    <p>We had booked to spend 3 nights trekking in the Sumatran jungle but of course getting there is quite the journey. Some 4 hours or so by car. Our driver was a cheerful chap and we chatted a little about London and Medan, comparing traffic at rush hour (he was delighted we had asked to leave at half ten as it meant he could avoid the worst traffic!) and the respective temperatures, which given the UK’s recent heatwave sending the temperature over 40 degrees, was a cause for some surprise, Medan tending to average around the low to mid thirties.</p>\n\n    <p>We rumbled on through the busy city, watching a range of streets go by from shiny, well-kept edifices sporting signs spelled out in flowers to the more usual stalls and shops which spilled out onto the roads.</p>\n\n    <p>We eventually left the city behind, ploughing on into greener spaces and eventually jungle. Row upon row of palms marched in ranks away from the car creating cool, green alleyways and the road was cracked and pot-holed as we bumped and swayed over it.</p>\n\n    <p>To our surprise, we arrived in Bukit Lawang a little after one. We had both read the advice that the journey took 4 hours and performed the same mental calculation of upping to to around six hours. Barely two and a half was unprecedented!</p>\n\n    <p>We were met at the eco lodge by our guide for the next couple of days and given a bright pink welcome drink while we sorted out the payment (which they’d asked for in Euros for some reason?) and chatted about our upcoming trekking and our previous visit back in 2018. He told us that 80% of the locals worked in tourism so the pandemic had been rough on the area. It was only in the last couple of months that tourists had started to return for the summer holiday.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double \">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52238670912_b8fb0e9998_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239933929_c5caf39d13_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We headed to our room to get settled in and have a quick shower to freshen up, and then sorted through our bags to re-pack for the following day’s jungle expedition. Then we wandered over to the lodge and settled on the upstairs sofas to chill. The room was completely open to the outdoors: sunshine streamed in, lizards pottered about the roof, the off moth fluttered through and the succulent jungle greenery leaned their leaves over the ledges. To our surprise, there was even a bit of wifi, but we were quite happy reading and passing the time quietly in the still, humid air. One side of the open room looked down over the rice which ran through the centre of the village, and the otherwise looked into the lodge’s courtyard. A small troupe of monkeys mucked about over the rooftops, munching on fruit, playing and antagonising each other, while small birds fluttered and came to rest for a moment on the vines which twined beside us.</p>\n\n    <p>After a while, we grew too warm however, and so headed back to our room and watched some Lost on the laptop.</p>\n\n    <p>Evening soon drew on and we returned to the lodge in search of sustenance. The day has clouded over somewhat and while we perched at a table inside the lodge, the heavens suddenly opened and a downpour commenced. Rain makes such a huge noise in the rainforest, slapping off leaves, drumming onto rooftops and swelling the river to a more insistent rushing. I remembered wistfully our guide telling us earlier that this was dry season. I was glad we’d decided to throw our ponchos into our trekking packs just in case. The trails were going to be muddy!</p>\n\n    <p>After our while, our hunger spurred us on to look for someone to order food from and eventually we caught the attention of the kitchen, found a menu and placed our order.</p>\n\n    <p>The food was fab! I went for my classic Mie Goreng but the kitchen offered a spicy version which I lapped up eagerly. And they were not wrong - it was super spicy and really tasty! I split a portion of fries with Pete (which were also fab and which I regretted offering to share but possibly that’s what married life is about) and Pete ordered a chicken dish in a sweet, fruity sauce with carrot and pineapple. He massively rated it.</p>\n\n    <p>As we were reaching the end of our meal, the local cat twined around my ankles mewing incessantly and while she was a pretty little thing, I highly doubted that she’d enjoy spicy noodles. I told her that Pete was the soft touch, assuming that he would offer her some of his chicken, and so he did.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239658363_e42e568aa2_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>She wasn’t sure initially but perked up once she’d tried it and her little mews turned into expectant sitting on the bench, paws on the table and finally standing next to Pete on the table as he offered her morsel after morsel.</p>\n\n    <p>One of the lodge staff came and whisked her away at this point, plonking her down unceremoniously pointing towards the outdoors. But of course she was having none of that, what with all the rain, and was soon back under my legs, before returning to Pete.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete by this point simply offered her his chicken bone so that she could nibble off the chicken herself (he had actually finished and there was very little left on the bone) which she attacked eagerly. She was then scooped away again by the staff before dashing back to us the third time without even pretending to go outside.</p>\n\n    <p>When the staff transported her away the third time, we don’t know where they took her but she didn’t reappear.</p>\n\n    <p>We filled out water bottles and headed upstairs to the open sitting area to read for a while after dinner. Even though it was pitch dark, it was only just half seven and with nothing pressing to do, it was nice to have a quiet evening. Lizards skittered across the ceiling, a bat flew through the room and the rain gradually slowed and stopped.</p>\n\n    <p>We headed back to our room for a round of tea in the - somewhat unexpected - heart-shaped mugs the lodge provided, watched another episode of Lost and then settled down for a good night’s rest before our trekking adventures of the morrow.</p>\n\n</section>",

Top honeymoon lie in action right there.</p>\n\n    <p>We were being picked up at six to go and spend the day visiting the Tumpak Sewu waterfalls and Goa Tetes, a nearby cave. We’d had a quick debate about whether to bring our swimwear as Pete thought swimming was a no, but I was sure I’d read somewhere that you could swim at the cave. In the end, we decided to bring it all on the off chance.</p>\n\n    <p>Our driver turned up promptly at six and was a jolly chap, and while he didn’t seem to speak any English (not really an issue) he had a nice comfy car which was a relief after yesterday’s trip! And consequently, I spent most of the two and a half hour journey asleep - I think we’d accrued a bit of a sleep debt.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52226198942_2439003f98_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227479449_76c4b51410_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>I woke up to find our driver sort of tooling around in a lost fashion, and this was confirmed when he pulled up at the side of the road and wandered off to find some directions. However, a handy local plus various assorted phone calls seemed to sort him out and we arrived within a couple of minutes. Bingo!</p>\n\n    <p>We were introduced to our guide whose name was Dian, and he explained that we would see the waterfall from the top, walk to the bottom and see the view from there and then go to visit the cave. All in all it would be about 3km. He mentioned that it would be wet under foot and checked that we didn’t mind our shoes getting wet - no problem, I’d worn my walking boots for this exact reason - and we asked about swimming and he said yes, we could. However, I’d already got a bag full of camera equipment, and I didn’t fancy bringing along an extra carrier with towel and swimmers and so on, so figured I’d just leave it in the car. I could paddle easily enough if I wanted to.</p>\n\n    <p>And so we set off for a nice chill waterfall walk.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228717023_7fe5fc49c5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52229191785_cda34c3e5f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Spoiler alert: we could not have been more wrong about the nature of this trip. It was insane, borderline death-defying, adventurous and demanding.</p>\n\n    <p>It was also the best thing we’ve done in Java. Unanimously.</p>\n\n    <p>The start of the trip was tame enough and we strolled for ten minutes or so along a concrete path through the encroaching green jungle, emerging at a viewing platform at the top of the waterfall.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double \">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227223508_c83f5749a4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227484534_c81d550b60_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Tumpak Sewu is magnificent, there are no two ways about it. It’s huge, falling in multiple streams around a crescent shaped gorge, emerging from dense green undergrowth and trees to plunge 120m to the rocks below. Pretty stunning.</p>\n\n    <p>We spent a while admiring the view and Dian offered to take some photos for us - this was handy as it turns out he has a great eye for a picture, but I suppose he does this pretty regularly for tourists.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228719976_2eb8b8d61c_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Then we began the descent to the bottom. To say it was steep is an understatement. The path was a bit steep in the same way that Mount Everest is a bit tall. Dian also told us that it had rained the previous day too, so of course the way was treacherous and slippy with mud and I had to go super slowly to keep my footing.</p>\n\n    <p>At points there was an identifiable path, at other points, random metal walkways had been bolted hastily in place and the occasional chunk of scaffolding pole speared to grab onto. However, these were invariably not very stable and it seemed safer to clutch onto rocks.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252893596_31412649c7_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We picked our way ever downwards, slowly and steadily, until eventually, the path itself became a waterfall. Dian was undaunted and simply started climbing down it. There was a rope to hold onto so clearly no biggie (???) and there was nothing for it but to get down on hands and knees, clutch onto slippery boulders and feel around with my boots underwater until I found the next stable foothold.</p>\n\n    <p>I was kind of exciting though.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double \">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52230351573_3d0a791bc0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52229004854_46f3ea1e3e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>In this manner, we eventually made it to the bottom, coming out onto a grey sandbank, a little downstream from the waterfall, sandwiched in a huge, deep gorge. Even though the falls themselves were out of sight, we could still hear the cascade and spray misted the air. The sides of the cliffs were immense, carpeted with ferns and vines and it was very much like being in Jurassic park, as Dian pointed out.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, we can keep count of how many movies and TV shoes we re-enacted.</p>\n\n    <p>Movies we lived: 1</p>\n\n    <p>Dian took some pictures of us - he was quite animated in his direction and in the end, I just let him keep hold of my phone for the duration as he snapped pictures all the time for us.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228445878_137d405e97_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>To get to the falls themselves, we had to wade through the river which had a decent current but was little more than knee-high. There was a rope to hold onto, the ends of which disappeared into a rugged pile of rocks, and we were soon scrambling up and down boulders on the other side of the river.</p>\n\n    <p>And then a short way upstream, we had to cross back again.</p>\n\n    <p>My boots were well and truly full of water by this point, and I was already quite glad I’d opted for leggings over shorts. They seemed to dry out pretty rapidly but usefully kept me from scraping my knees.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double \">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228835545_18700a358a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228752428_794df506b8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Emerging out at the bottom of the waterfall was pretty spectacular. The air was saturated with spray and we climbed up a rocky outcrop to take in the immensity of the view: blue skies, reddish rocks, dense green vegetation and crashing white sheets of water all harmonised to make an incredible natural spectacle. Pete spotted a rainbow up in the mist and Dian snapped a quick picture which he later showed us. We could easily be characters in Lost.</p>\n\n    <p>Movies we lived: 2</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, I pointed out to Pete that even if we had gone to Hawaii, I don’t think we could have hiked in rainforest or jungle any more dramatic than that which lay before us. It had been an effort, and goodness only knows it was going to be a pull back up the side of the gorge, but when you have 120m of cascading river, topped with a soaring distant volcano, I reckon you’re basically onto a winner.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52251923092_589d3a7b89_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253179794_2ab43fd3ff_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We posed for a bunch of photos, because obviously, and then set off back the way we’d come. We had seen surprisingly few other tourists - maybe half a dozen in total - and a lot of the time, we couldn’t see anyone else around, which is always kind of magic when that happens. Reading up later, it seems that Tumpak Sewu isn’t on the main tourist route, and given that Java doesn’t seem to be inundated with tourists anyway (people tending to opt for Bali) that left a relatively small number of visitors for such an impressive location.</p>\n\n    <p>We crossed back through the river back to where we’d first dropped down from the cliffs, and then began our walk to the Cave.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253188519_7b435dec55_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>If I’d thought the path was tricky before, this was a whole new level. It was less of a walk and more of a scramble over rocks and boulders, steeply up and down, and most of the time through little waterfalls. I was completely drenched from the waist down and pretty damp all over, and Pete fared similarly. It was, as ever, awesome to have him there though to steady me when things got extra slippery.</p>\n\n    <p>We plopped out eventually by the river again, and there was another sizeable waterfall splashing down above us. The rock seemed to pour down the cliff alongside the water, sculpted by the torrent into wonderful fluid shapes, twisted spindles and delicate overhangs. In places, it was hard to distinguish between the vines that spread long fingers over the ledges and the stone sculptures carved by the inexorable passage of time and water. Pete pondered the geography and evolution of the area aloud and it would have been interesting the learn about how such places are formed.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227435352_ebc477e37c_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We’d reached a group of locals who were busy taking pictures and setting up cameras and we of course did the same, posing at the base of the cascade while Dian did his thing with the camera.</p>\n\n    <p>And then suddenly he was yelling at us to run and pointing up behind us - Pete grabbed my arm and we dashed forwards towards Dian. I didn’t look behind me but heard a huge crash and when we reached the water line, I turned to see a giant boulder rolling towards us. We hopped out of the way as it’s impact with the sandy floor had slowed it’s progress but we were definitely pretty shaken.</p>\n\n    <p>Another guide appeared from somewhere in response to all the noise and yelling and we all just stared at the boulder which had hurtled over the top of the falls.</p>\n\n    <p>I know what you’re thinking: Indiana Jones.</p>\n\n    <p>Movies we lived: 3</p>\n\n    <p>Dian and the new guide warned us to stay back but there seemed to be no imminent landslide and eventually, they waved us on. Dian was actually incredibly apologetic, bless him, but it wasn’t his fault: these things happen and there’s no way of controlling them. And if he hadn’t be watching and warned us out of the way, we would have been in serious trouble. Just: yikes.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, it doesn’t do to dwell on such things and despite slightly shaky knees, we pressed on and reached a small pool at the side of the river. The locals who were taking photos grinned at us and commented “Lucky!” which I think was a consensus all round.</p>\n\n    <p>They’d brought a bunch of fruit with them: little scaly-looking brown things, about the size of a kiwi but with a pointy tip, and we’d been seeing them everywhere. We asked what they were and Dian told us they were called Salak (or, as it turns out, snake fruit due to their scales - very apt. Very asp.) He asked the group if we could try one and they happily obliged, so he popped one open for us and we snacked on the fruit inside.</p>\n\n    <p>The interior looks a bit like 3 giant garlic cloves: each one contains a large, acorn-like seed and the surrounding fruit is smooth and dry, a bit crisp like an apples, but more rubbery than wet. However, it crunched up rather nicely and tasted a bit like pineapple and pear. Yum!</p>\n\n    <p>And actually, as all I’d had to eat up to that point was half a cereal bar, it was very welcome.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253394215_b07f58c71f_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n        \n    <p>It was time to begin the climb to the cave, and it was no surprise to either of us at this point that the route seemed to be directly up through the waterfall. We just had to make the best of it, and try not to think about the fact that when we climbed a waterfall in New Zealand, we’d had to wear hard hats, a harness and be attached to bolted down safety lines in two places at all times.</p>\n\n    <p>It’s all chill.

A wise move as the torrent of water was unrelenting and by the time I’d clambered through the falls, I may as well have had a shower fully clothed. Pete’s experience was similar. It was exhilarating though!</p>\n\n    <p>Dian hoped through the falls in a manner that was nimble enough to be embarrassing - he wore sliders for the whole trip naturally, the terrain presenting zero obstacles for him - and joined us as we ducked through a curtain of water and entered the cave.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52230347851_7dd41cfb42_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52253188559_5a40b49d9c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>While the cave wasn’t enormous, it was extremely intricate. It seemed to be formed from draping sheets of velvet which, when you pressed your hands to then, were of course textured rocks. Stalactites hung from the gloom above, some dripping water on us, some slender and soundly and some grasping the floor in enormous columns. We were almost up to our knees in water and our footsteps disturbed the silty sand, sending it dancing into murky clouds. Despite this, Dian pointed out the tiny fish which swam about and we laughed, attempting to scoop one up in our hands before pouring them gently back into their home.</p>\n\n    <p>There were lots of little nooks and crannies in the cave, with weird and wonderful organic shapes and as we splashed about and explored I was constantly compelled to touch the rocks as they were so tactile; their feel was often completely different to their appearances. Pete wondered aloud if bats lived inside the cave, and said he felt like Tomb Raider.</p>\n\n    <p>Movies we lived: 4</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double \">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52230347786_c10e5f68cb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52230615404_7bd9f87af6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We scrambled up a rocky slope towards the back where a waterfall came from nowhere, gushing out over the stones lost in darkness above it. It was surprising how little the light penetrated given that the cave was quite small,</p>\n\n    <p>We emerged back through a curtain of spray to begin our climb back down the gorge. Crossing over the waterfall, we collected our bags and climbed and slithered down the way we’d come up.</p>\n\n    <p>However, we didn’t go all the way down: just far enough to connect to the “path” back up the gorge to the start of the trail. Dian told us that was the end of the water crossings so we plonked down and emptied the sand, grit, small stones and rocks that had found their way unbidden into our shoes.</p>\n\n    <p>We poured plenty of water out too.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double \">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227473697_7717741508_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228479158_5413a8580b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>The climb was steep and quite the effort but fairly uneventful. Going up is easier than going down, but also, it’s harder. Fact. IYKYK.</p>\n\n    <p>And if you don’t know, going up always feels more stable and steady than going down. However, it makes you much more out of breath.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, we trudged along behind Dian and plodded our way methodically up the steep, rock-cut steps that marked our passage. The steps were often knee-high and above requiring legs to put in a solid effort, but they got there in the end and after a couple of short rests, we achieved an actual paved path near the top.</p>\n\n    <p>We stopped at a small stall for a break and Dian asked the lady if we could eat a couple of her snake fruit, she gladly obliged which was very kind and refused to take any money for them, so Pete paid her to use the loo instead. Dian had a good chuckle over Pete trying to open the Salak, the skin refusing to give and then seeds popping willy-nilly out of the cloves. But we enjoyed the snack and it revived us for our final walk.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227468022_8a13bc427e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252922013_0fe0c896ce_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>It was only another ten minutes walk or so back to where we’d left the driver and we turned down the offer of a motorbike ride and stepped it out. We were both keen to ditch our footwear at this point: Pete reckoned he had half the river still swimming about in his shoes. Which was funny, because the other half was in mine.</p>\n\n    <p>While I couldn’t really change, I did manage to swap walking boots for flip flops and was able to dry off a little with my towel, which felt good, Pete swapped his soaking shorts for his unworn (and therefore dry) swimmers and then we settled into a table at the little lunch stall for a bite to eat.</p>\n\n    <p>The lady brought us chicken soup, rice and some sort of salsa. I scooped up a spoonful of the latter to taste and was surprised to find it to be absolutely fiery hot, so I used it quite sparingly after that. Tastes great though!</p>\n\n    <p>The soup was also delicious, being more a sort of broth with shredded cabbage, noodles, chicken and some unknown veg, but really well seasoned with tasty spices and lemongrass. Absolutely hit the spot and it was so nice to be able to tuck into an actual local dish.</p>\n\n    <p>Take that, Burger King.</p>\n\n    <p>Once we’d finished our lunch, it was time to head back to Malang. I spread my towel over the seat to avoid transferring too much damp to the car, and we made the journey back to our hotel. As we set off, Pete said I could have both of his thoughts (which seems imply that he only has two but I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he has more).</p>\n\n    <p>Thought one: “This gorge? It’s gorge-ous.”</p>\n\n    <p>He was quite proud of that.</p>\n\n    <p>Thought two: Pete was struck by how people living in really remote parts of the world - like the Indonesian jungle - whose living conditions seem relatively simple to us, are still whipping our their iPhones to make a quick video call at the drop of a hat. And I get what he’s saying: you don’t think “shack in the jungle” and immediately picture high speed internet. But it does kind of show how much of a necessity the technology has become and it’s ever more becoming the single biggest factor which unites humanity.</p>\n\n    <p>I alternated between listening to my audiobook and dozing and we arrived back at about half two, stumbling inside clutching damp bags and sodden gear.</p>\n\n    <p>Back in our room, we unpacked, peeled off soggy clothes and aimed to wash our boots in the shower. The irony being, I pointed out to Pete, that the only dry piece of clothing to survive the trip was my swimming costume.</p>\n\n    <p>It has been an energetic day so we were quite happy to chill for a bit before dinner, enjoying being clean and dry, checking out everything we needed for the next day and working on editing photos and journaling.</p>\n\n    <p>And tea and biscuits. Equally important to work on those.</p>\n\n    <p>We decided to try dinner at the hotel and set forth, armed with our hunger and short list of errands. We first popped over to Indomart (traffic defeated) and picked up some more milk. And biscuits. Because somehow, inexplicably, we were out of both.</p>\n\n    <p>Then we returned to the hotel and hit the restaurant. The waiter came to meet us as we entered the dining room and we asked for a table, miming two people. He looked taken aback and unsure, but we repeated our gestures and mimed eating until he seemed to cotton on that we wanted to dine. Mission accomplished.</p>\n\n    <p>There were two other occupied tables but otherwise the room was quiet and empty. After a while, we wondered if the restaurant wasn’t serving food at all as no one was eating and the other two tables seemed to be deep in consultation. Eventually though, one table finished what they were doing and the waiter brought us a menu. It seems the restaurant only has two and they were both in use.</p>\n\n    <p>Having said that, the menu wasn’t massively useful to us as we didn’t really understand what was on it. So I ordered mie goreng as I knew what it was, and when I’d told Pete that I was pretty sure that “ayam” meant chicken, he picked a dish at random that had chicken in the name.</p>\n\n    <p>The complete and utter failure of the sporadic-at-best wifi didn’t give us a chance to decipher anything really.</p>\n\n    <p>The food was a long time in coming, but come it did and was pretty tasty. I slurped up my noodles, the omelette pieces on top were lovely and light and I got some prawn crackers with it which I call a win.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete’s dinner turned out to be fried chicken pieces and a sweet-and-sour sauce which he was actually pretty happy with. The man loves a nug and that’s basically what he got.</p>\n\n    <p>After dinner we totalled up our cash, did a quick back-of-envelope calculation to try and work out what we’d need for the next week, and then popped to the cash machine over the road to top up our supplies. The ATM pods are always air conned to the max and we accidentally disturbed a tiny lizard. Good times to be had all round.</p>\n\n    <p>Back at the hotel, we collected our laundry and they promised to deliver it to our room, and we checked how long it would take to get to the airport the next day. Errands finally complete!</p>\n\n    <p>Our laundry did indeed show up to our room and as we were having a cuppa (with milk, baby!) reception rang and said they would shuttle us to the airport for free! Mega win.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228836580_6ab0a063f8_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>So all told, with a little light packing, more tea and some biscuits, it was a successful evening’s effort. All that remained was to watch and snuggle down for a good, sensibly timed, sleep.</p>\n\n</section>",

Even thought we’d aimed for a solid 4 hours of sleep (party time) I got significantly less than two.</p>\n\n    <p>This volcano business better be worth it.</p>\n\n    <p>We had booked a sunrise trip to go and see Mount Bromo, an active volcano a few hours away from Malang. And if you want the sunrise baby, you’ve got to get up early.</p>\n\n    <p>So we dragged ourselves downstairs with our daypacks and slumped in reception waiting for our ride. Despite some misgivings about the driver possibly turning up to the previous mystery hotel, our ride showed up 37 minutes late (again, just within IST - Indonesian Standard Time) and we set off. Would have liked the extra sleep though.</p>\n\n    <p>The ride in question was technically a Toyota Landcruiser although I just thought of it as the jeep, and Pete and I clambered into the back in the dark. It was extremely cramped: there was a short bench on either side of the van and a French couple occupied one of them leaving Pete and I to take the other so that I was pressed against the driver’s seat and Pete was jammed against the door. We arranged our legs in the limited available space, alternating with the French couple and figuring out the most mutually beneficial system, and the jeep bounced and rumbled off into the night.</p>\n\n    <p>So, it’s worth saying it was not comfortable! I had naively thought I would drop off during the drive and catch a bit of kip, but that was a non-starter. The jeep was loud, and while it wasn’t super quick, it was powerful and never gave up. It was also jerky and bumpy and in order to stay perched on our benches Pete and I ended up squeezing together tightly, holding on to each other, the driver’s headrest and some convenient(ish) canvas straps nailed to the ceiling. It wasn’t long before our bottoms were quite numb.</p>\n\n    <p>In the end, I decided to listen to the end of my audiobook (the excellent London Rules from the Slough House series) and that proved a solid distraction. And in many ways, the journey passed relatively quickly. After a couple of hours, leaving the city of Malang behind and gradually ascending narrower mountain roads, we passed the point that “ordinary” cars were permitted to drive: the sheer gradient of the road coupled with the twists and turns proved the jeep very much a necessity. I had to keep myself in my seat using my legs and hanging onto the strap in order to not completely slide down the seat and squash Pete on the steeper inclines. We made a brief pit stop and we all piled out of the jeep to stretch our legs. We learned that the other guy in the jeep was a fellow Londoner but as he was travelling solo, had had the enviable position of riding shotgun. Fair play.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete and I switched positions for the last hour of the drive - having tested both seats, I rated the back spot more highly as I could lean against the door. The road gave out, and we drove across country for a while, bumping over sandy dunes and rutted muddy tracks, throwing up clouds of dust. Eventually we reached more road and started to climb again; I could feel the altitude in the popping of my ears.</p>\n\n    <p>We passed the first lookout point and the second, each crowded with jeeps and shuffling tourists making their way through the dark. Our driver explained to us that we would be going to the final and highest viewpoint to watch the sunrise; he seemed to think this the best, and who were we to argue?</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52223359052_06d7c745a2_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224365221_a46c6e1829_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>He found a space to wedge the jeep in between scores of others and, advising us to stick together, led us up the road. We climbed a short way before taking a footpath through an array of stalls. We were ushered into one - brightly lit and full of chattering tourists - and our driver called friendly greetings to the owner. We were brought a hot drink each (tea for me, coffee for the others) and a plate of fresh, hot fried bananas also landed on the table.</p>\n\n    <p>And it was all delicious! Because sometimes when it’s 3:45am, it turns out what you really need is a hot cup of something that thinks it’s tea and a tasty fried banana with a thin, crispy, battered shell. Until this point, I hadn’t really noticed it was cold, but having a got drink to hold certainly put the shivers at bay, even though I think they were more due to tiredness than actual cold.</p>\n\n    <p>As we munched, our driver explained to us that he had a special strategy to help up make the most of our visit. Instead of joining the throng heading down the mountain after sunrise, we would hang back, visit other viewpoints that would be empty, and go to see the volcanic crater a little after everyone else making it less busy. A strategy indeed!</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52223360662_18f63d0fd2_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Our morning snack consumed, our driver led us up to the viewpoint. You would think it was Arctic, the sheer quantity of clothes and hats and blankets and gloves that most people seemed to be labouring under. As we got to the top, a series of big concrete steps formed seats for the hoards waiting. But our driver had different plan in mind. Checking out a special area at the front first which was full, he then proceeded to the barriers between the cliff top and seating. Looking back over his shoulder he called “I have a secret spot!” And then he swung himself under the railings and jumped down about 5 foot to a ledge below.</p>\n\n    <p>And so we followed him. Lemmings.</p>\n\n    <p>To be fair, there was a sizeable space in the dirt underneath the barriers and with no other barriers or tourists to get in the way, our view would be uninterrupted. It was 4:30am with sunrise set to occur around 5:00am. Our driver said we should catch the sunrise, take some pictures, hang around a bit and return to the jeep for half six. And off he went.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240850827_fda9065951_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>That left us with a bit of time to kill so Pete and I plopped to the floor and nestled together to keep warm. I was reasonably snug in my hoody - apart from cold hands - but Pete’s clothing was lighter than mine and in the end, he borrowed my waterproof as an extra layer. We were out of the wind which was good and Pete wrapped his arms around me so that he could also warm his fingers in my hoody front pocket. We watched the stars overhead and waited for shapes to appear out of the darkness of the landscape below.</p>\n\n    <p>It began with a red tinge to the sky in the east and this gradually brightened to orange, showing up the purple-grey splashes of clouds over the horizon and distant mountain tops reaching out of low-lying cloudscapes.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241829331_176cfdd1ba_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>As this grew stronger, we could see more of the view mapped out below us: the jagged line where lush, green fields suddenly dropped away to grey, volcanic lands. The sea of sand, stretching below us as a flat, almost featureless plain. And the cones of the volcanos jutting forth, Mount Bromo a gaping crater, smoking quietly.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240851362_4375532f1a_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n\n    <p>The sunshine gradually bathed all this in golden light and we enjoyed watching the illumination, taking pictures and drinking it all in. As other tour groups started to dissipate, we scrambled back up and over the barriers to enjoy the views from the seating area above. The sun soon had heat in its path and my chilled fingers started to defrost, while Pete spread forth his arms in welcome, calling to the solar orb “Absolute rays! Heat me up, rays”. He was quite animated and it made me laugh.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241842993_084587bde7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241828676_0c60624085_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Local women wondered around trying to sell us bunches of dried edelweiss, including some blooms that were dyed and shaped to look like teddies.

We stopped at two other look-outs on the way down giving us slightly different perspectives on the volcanos, and the driver who was clearly a dab hand with the old holiday snaps, took some photos for us. Even though it was only just gone seven, the sun was getting hot, and we started needed to shed our outer layers and plaster on hats and shades.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224380433_1c3470f55b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52223360697_103db52942_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We were also getting peckish and so we were all quite happy when our next stop was down in the sea of sand for a picnic. Up close, we could see the valleys and crevasses carved into the slopes of the volcano - from above, they had seemed to be small scratches, but level with cones themselves, we could see that each rise and fall had the magnitude of a hill in its own right. We munched through our breakfast boxes while we contemplated our geological companions, and I enjoyed an orange, a cheese and boiled egg sandwich (although I couldn’t get my egg to crack so I had to bash it on the jeep in the end) and a jam sandwich. Works for me - it was tasty and perked us up for the next and final phase of the day.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224383681_d7033351de_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>But was it breakfast?

A short-ish climb followed and while it was relatively steep, it should have been easy. However, the altitude was making its presence felt and I was gasping for air remarkably quickly compared to how I should have been feeling.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52241841413_ca75462535_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Locals with horses were constantly looping around attempting to sell us a ride to the steaming crater, but we resisted and finally made it to the last stretch. A couple of hundred steps led up to the volcano’s rim (236 give or take, according to Pete) and we plodded up then slowly, starting to feel a little too warm under the beating sun and taking a couple of little rest breaks.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240849322_e5b62c895d_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Reaching the crater was quite impressive: we looked down into a hole sunk deep in the heart of the volcano and as smoke twisted and curled in little puffs from the abyss, I felt like I could almost make out hot, bubbling sulphurous water.

I think we are gaining in maturity.</p>\n\n    <p>Which was true until I felt the need to sing “He was a crater boy” to Pete who I think was enormously impressed and amused at my wit but managed to suppress his response quite effectively.

Once the rest of our crew appeared, we piled into the jeep for one last time to journey back to Malang.</p>\n\n    <p>We actually dropped the French couple at a nearby village which gave Pete and I loads of space in the back of the van. Initially this seemed great, but we soon found that being wedged in does actually help you stay in your seat and we crammed back in together for part of the way so that I could lean on Pete.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52223386577_dac273b741_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>When we reached actual roads again, I returned to my own side of the Jeep with half an ear on a podcast and managed to doze a bit.

A cup of tea and an episode of Modern Family fortified us enough to sort out some laundry and head out for a bit to eat.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224661894_786abd09ce_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224879550_ae6420d73a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We ended up at Burger King again due to a dearth of local options and neither of us could face the battle with taxis and the insane city traffic required to get anywhere. We put away a burger each, tried on a cardboard crown which we decided not to keep, and the headed to Indomart to pick up a few bits for dinner. We were both eager for a relaxed evening in and and early night and so some spicy noodles were just what we needed.</p>\n\n    <p>I was going to pay with cash but Pete insisted on trying my card first. Indomart never take our card despite having a machine, and Pete takes this as a personal insult. I bet him 1000 IDR that it wouldn’t work and when I eventually had to hand over cash, after unnecessarily elongating the payment process, I won my bet.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete: you owe me 6p.

A winning combo.</p>\n\n    <p>We were aiming for an early night and given the minimal sleep we’d experienced the previous night, we were reasonably hopefully that we’d drop off early. So with bags packed, another round of teas made to enjoy with a biscuit - my favourite Vietnamese peanut butter jobbies, natch - we settled down</p>\n\n    <p>With our alarms set for 5:45 the next morning because why not?</p>\n\n    <p>therealmountdoom</p>\n\n</section>",

Mostly I was just happy to shut my eyes and relax.</p>\n\n    <p>Around six, Pete poked me awake. The stewards collected our blankets and we proceeded to pull into a station that was similar name to the one we expected but not quite right. We weren’t sure if we should get off or not, Pete was consulting the map and the clock, realising that we weren’t quite in the right place, but also slightly concerned that the train might not stop at the next station.</p>\n\n    <p>In the end, I waved my ticket at a member of train staff who gestured that we should not in fact get off the train. This seems to be the go-to way to get around on Indonesian trains: if you show your ticket to enough people, they’ll help you get on and off the right train. Winner!</p>\n\n    <p>When we arrived at the right station, we hustled off with the crowds and made our way to the main concourse and exit. We needed to find a taxi to our hotel, but try as we might, we couldn’t locate a taxi rank. Loads of people were getting into pre-booked cars but the normal swarm of punters who normally try and flog you a ride weren’t present.</p>\n\n    <p>We used our standby of asking a guard, but he mimed using a phone to book one and without a local sim or any wifi, that wasn’t going to work. Pete asked another guy who was manning the traffic, but he indicated the same thing. No go.</p>\n\n    <p>How was there no taxi rank at a busy station?</p>\n\n    <p>Pete reckoned it was an hour and a half’s walk through the city to our hotel which felt like a no with the heat and our bags. Our next idea involved walking out of the station and trying to flag down a taxi on the road beyond.</p>\n\n    <p>We didn’t even make it to the road before we realised there was no pavement and just insane, kamikaze traffic which is proving to be a staple of each city in Java.</p>\n\n    <p>We went back into the station and mimed to the security guards that we wanted to go back in and investigate the exit on the other side. We mentioned the word taxi and he seemed to think this was a good idea. Would this work?</p>\n\n    <p>We climbed up the walkways to the bridge over the platforms, walked around the back of what I can only assume is the Indonesian equivalent of Zumba class which was attended but a large number of ladies wearing head scarves, and trekked back down to find the station’s other exit.</p>\n\n    <p>We were immediately pounced upon by a chap trying to sell us a lift. We were so grateful we didn’t even haggle. We hopped into the back of a rickety van, whose windscreen had so many stickers plastered to it that the driver couldn’t see out properly and kept having to contort into awkward angles to look for traffic lights, and some 15 minutes later, we clambered out again at our hotel. Phew!</p>\n\n    <p>Not an adventure you want to have when you’ve had scant sleep on an overnight train.</p>\n\n    <p>The hotel looked lovely - a top find from Pete - and at reception, they said for an extra 200000 IDR, we could have the room immediately. Given that this equates to £12, we were keen to grab some shuteye and so we toddled on up to our sleeping quarters, dumped off our bags and fell asleep.</p>\n\n    <p>We did set an alarm for around nine in case we fancied breakfast, but actually when nine came, what we fancied was two extra hours of kip. So it was more like eleven when we finally surfaced and felt ready to take on the world.</p>\n\n    <p>We had a few errands to accomplish for the day, namely to plan and book a couple of excursions we wanted to do, and to acquire food and water. We did a bit of internet research but would rather book direct with locals. So we sorted ourselves out, got ready and left the hotel around one in the afternoon.</p>\n\n    <p>This immediately proved to be a poor decisions and after ten minutes of stomping around and getting nowhere, we hadn’t spotted any taxis or means of acquiring one. So we returned to our hotel and they ordered one for us. Fair play.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete had identified some tour companies on Google maps he thought looked promising and so we took the taxi to a nearby park and set off on food to investigate. It was a bit of a shambles to be honest. The pavement wasn’t so much a pavement as a heap of dust, rubble, building projects and weeds. You had to walk in the road half the time and then if felt like we were fair game for the jostling motorbikes. We did find one of the agencies but when we asked a chap inside about booking a tour, it was clear he had no idea what we were talking about. Fair play. We thought maybe it was more of a travel agent for Indonesians instead of a tour office for tourists.</p>\n\n    <p>We walked all the way along the street, crossed the road and picked our way back down it without finding anything that looked promising. I was just about done figuring we’d have to book through the big internet tour companies after all, when Pete spotted a shack that said Tourist Information. It looked dark and shut up and distinctly unpromising as we circled it, but the fourth side yielded a door and lady inside, sitting in front of posters advertising tours. So chalk one up for Pete for showing top notch perseverance!</p>\n\n    <p>The lady was able to book us the Mount Bromo tour we were hoping to do for less than half the price of the internet, and gave us information about the waterfall visit we were interested in too. We decided to ponder this over lunch, and Pete - who is never one to miss a trick - had already clocked a Korean BBQ place over the road. It seemed popular with lots of tables full and as we entered, various staff scuttled about, debating who was going to try and deal with the foreigners.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224337746_876d400af9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224373933_79ed4aafea_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section> \n\n    <p>In the end, one of the waiters stepped up to the challenge, took us to a table and explained the menu. We opted for the “deluxe” which sounds fancy but was the most basic deal meaning we would just use the grill and we would stick with chicken (instead of chicken and beef - that’s apparently more deluxe). He then lit our grill pan, spread it with butter and indicated that we should help ourselves to food from anything in the fridges with blue labels. Simple enough.</p>\n\n    <p>And so we made a very tasty lunch, sampling chicken marinated in a range of different sauces - Inferno was the best in my opinion - and tasting one or two of the extras. Onions fried up quite well and I added them to some noodles I found, but slightly less appetising were various fish balls and things. They were just a bit bland and, well, odd. With several glasses of chilled squash and a soft serve ice cream each to finish, we made a good meal!</p>\n\n    <p>Actually, the ice cream nearly didn’t happen as Pete couldn’t get the machine to work. However, I got one of the waitresses to show me, and she pushed a button and then it worked fine so I could pull my own ices cream. I also added a scoop of nuts but they went pretty much everywhere except on my ice cream so that was a fail. Once I’d eaten a bit more of my ice cream and there was space in the tub, I managed to sneak back for extra nuts and I do not regret it because yolo.</p>\n\n    <p>After lunch, we popped back to tourist information and booked the waterfall tour, having a lovely chat with two students who were interning there and hoping to become tour guides when they graduated. They were so friendly and welcoming and we discussed the challenge of understanding English in a range of accents. They reckoned Australians were the hardest to understand, but also the Dutch.</p>\n\n    <p>The lady who’s booked for us ordered us a taxi and this caused no end of trouble as she couldn’t find the address in her phone. She suggested we walk but again, we were a solid ninety minute’s walk away in a city which is definitely not pedestrian friendly. A local cat hopped into the room and jumped up onto the table to stick its paw and nose in, pretending to help but really just after some nice strokes, and eventually, the lady said she’d ordered a car on her phone and it would be with us shortly.</p>\n\n    <p>When the car pulled up, she told us it would be 12000 IDR which seemed suspiciously cheap, and sure enough after about 5 minutes, the driver pulled us into the wrong hotel.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224609074_c4436d6a06_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224336736_bbd24ba6ff_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section> \n\n    <p>We spent an unproductive few minutes arguing, him saying it was our hotel, us saying it wasn’t, until the hotel porter came to the car and backed us up, saying this wasn’t the hotel we were looking for. Fact. I mean, there was a totally different name plastered across the sign.</p>\n\n    <p>Another round of negotiations ensued and we lost, agreeing to pay 70000 to get us back to our hotel. We couldn’t really do a lot without the app and the whole thing was a bit of a disaster. Clearly just getting a taxi isn’t really a thing here.</p>\n\n    <p>So a little before five, we found ourselves back at our hotel having paid over double what the fee should have been. Sigh. Win some lose some.</p>\n\n    <p>We spent a bit of time chilling in our room. It was satisfying to have the next couple of days planned and organised and we sorted out our budgets and cards, pondered when and where to do our laundry and put together a blog post. Plus we had a cup of tea and some biscuits because you can take us out of the U.K. and give us mediocre teabags and powdered milk, but you can’t take away our unshakable belief in the power of a brew and a biccie to pick you up.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, Pete was so overcome when we reached the end of the biscuits that I performed a short haiku of lament. I only turned in for the end as I was concentrating on writing my journal but it was terribly poetic and finished on the phrase:</p>\n\n    <p>“Light, empty, sadness”</p>\n\n    <p>And was punctuated by Pete hefting the empty packet in a forlorn way. He refused to repeat the full haiku though so that will be lost to memory, and a great sadness to mankind that will be.</p>\n\n    <p>I feel like womankind will get over it.</p>\n\n    <p>Eventually we roused ourselves to head out in search of some evening snacks and to top up our cash reserves - Indonesia is very much a cash economy and very few places will take cards. We set out into the now dark evening and played chicken with the traffic, trying to get to a shop that was about 2 minutes walk away but nestled on the wrong size of about 6 death traps. By which I mean roads filled with Indonesian Drivers. After about 45 minutes or so, we wiggled through a tiny gap in the onslaught and made it over to Indomart. We were become Indomart regulars: patronising these portals of convenient snack foods that kept us fed.</p>\n\n    <p>We spent an enjoyable time selecting our spoils for the evening, playing noodle roulette with all the different coloured packaging that we could read. Our game plan works on 3 basic principles:</p>\n\n    <p>1) The noodles should come in packaging you can eat out of, hotel rooms rarely supplying crockery for such a purpose.</p>\n\n    <p>2) They should be spicy AF. Angry black and red colouring on the packet and extra spiky fonts are usually a good indicator of this.</p>\n\n    <p>3) If the writing looks like it might be sort of Korean, you’re on to a winner.</p>\n\n    <p>We found some noodles that fit this principles, I stocked up on my new favourite peanut butter biscuits and my new favourite BBQ potato flavour crisps, and we picked up an apple each because it felt like we ought to eat a nutrient.</p>\n\n    <p>Apples were crazy expensive again. But it’s worth it for the scurvy avoidance I suppose. We also found a pack of black tea which was handy as our hotel only supplied green. It’s not the same. And my personal stash of teabags purloined and saved from various establishments was running low.</p>\n\n    <p>We made it back across the traffic with our haul intact, topped up our funds at the cash machine and retreated to our room to make noodles and watch Slow Horses.</p>\n\n    <p>The noodles did not disappoint, and we were both silently weeping into our respective pots. Tears of joy, naturally. Meanwhile, we had to eat them away from the bed as blood-red chilli sauce and clean white sheets do not a combo make.</p>\n\n    <p>While I do enjoy having meals out, I enjoy it more when it’s something we do for fun, instead of something we have to schlep around and figure out every night. Eating out is awesome, but I also totally love the evenings we spend hunkered down after a good day, just relaxing, reflecting on our adventures and tearing up over ridiculous chillis. Get yourself a travel partner who will eat insanely spicy noodles with a spork in bed with you while you watch Netflix. That’s living, right there.</p>\n\n    <p>And yes, we did bring our sporks with us for exactly this occasion.</p>\n\n    <p>We sampled the rest of our snax relaxing back against the pillows and it was soon time for one last tea (for me, Pete somehow declined) and bed. An actual full night in a proper room. Luxury!\n\n    <h1>Day 10</h1>\n\n    <p>We got up around eight and headed down to investigate the breakfast buffet. It was the now-familiar Indonesian breakfast spread - although to be fair, we aren’t sure what’s traditional and what’s just bonus buffet material.</p>\n    \n    <p>Anyway, I had noodles and a vegetable omelette, a tiny banana and some cornflakes and to finished, a donut.</p>\n    \n    <p>I suspect the latter of not being traditional, but everywhere we go for breakfast has a cake platter so it seems rude not to indulge.</p>\n    \n    <p>Pete opted for boiled eggs, some chicken, rice and a slice of a curious egg and vegetable omelettey thing that had a crispy outer coating. It was pretty good - I think I liked it more than Pete did.</p>\n    \n    <p>Neither of us could bring ourselves to try and opaque and faintly luminous jelly slabs that faded from bright pink to an aqua green. There’s something about food that wobbles and glistens in that way that just says to you: no.</p>\n    \n    <p>No idea what it was.</p>\n    \n    <p>The only downside was that tea isn’t really a breakfast thing here, but I soldiered on impressively anyway.</p>\n    \n    <p>Once we’d got ourselves ready for the day, we headed down to the hotel lobby and asked them to ring us a taxi. As we waited, loads of people were coming and going and we thought there was probably a wedding taking place as everyone seemed dressed up. Not that our shorts and tees weren’t super glamorous of course, but we couldn’t compete when it came to beading and sequins.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240057206_69ae853d73_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Our taxi arrived and whisked us off to our destination: Jodipan.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240342109_30709ee9f7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240545345_af21c1726c_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>    \n\n    <p>Jodipan is a small area of Malang with an interesting recent history.

Which is about 30p. We spent the next hour or so wandering happily among the houses, squeezing between little alleyways and exploring the beautiful and cheerful decor. We found murals, painter stairways, passages hung with umbrellas and signs made from plastic bottles. The paths were clear and free from rubbish (unlike most of the rest of the pavements we’ve attempted to traverse) and steep staircases had ramps down the middle so that residents can get their motorbikes in and out. We saw a few people here and there but it was mostly quiet.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239075112_59b4a6756f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239074202_3b3e8e12e6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section> \n\n    <p>We crossed a foot bridge over the river and then entered Kampung Tridi (3D Village), paid another 5000 IDR each, accepted a souvenir elephant keyring and continued to explore. The village on this side of the river was similarly decorated, and we once again enjoyed the murals, spotted scrawny kittens slinking about, hens being expelled from doorways and loads of pot plants and seedlings planted in cut-off plastic bottles creating a leafy feel. We found a couple of view-points featuring classic, honeymoon heartshaped frames, and it was fun to take some pictures.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224832915_d7b444d19d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224343241_7c6aa1276e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section> \n\n    <p>We were slightly struck by the strangeness of the situation: we we wandering around gawping at other people’s lives to some extent and it made us think about whether this was exploitative.

Kampung Biru Arema (the Blue Village) had seen how their neighbours had fared following their paint job and figured they may as well do the same thing. This village has focused on one palette however, and the shades and tones of blue on blue are cool and inviting. Again, we say many murals, most notably for the football team, whose mascot featured around every corner and whose portraits adorned one wall. We also saw two or three murals advertising the outdoor paint that had presumably played a key role in the transformation.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224358506_ffe9738efb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224374583_f8b4f33e4e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>  \n\n    <p>This village had a slightly different character: there was no one to pay at any point and it seemed a little bit more like invading someone’s private life. A gaggle of small children followed us for a while, calling “Hello! Hello Mister!” and giggled, turning away shyly and hanging back whenever we returned their waves and hellos.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224630484_a32b3767d5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224374168_c55a96ddc6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>   \n\n    <p>We began to feel more like we were thrusting ourselves into a small local community after a while, and so we decided to head out of the village. I think not having paid to enter did make it seem more like we were treating people like zoo animals and without an explicit invitation to poke around, it was starting to seem a bit like an invasion of privacy. So we ducked out, wandering beneath the hanging lanterns and the lovely hanging orbs constructed from plastic bottles (a craft for the Guides to try, I reckon!) and returned to the road.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52240338889_875ea171c7_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>   \n            \n    <p>Given the challenges we’d faced finding taxis, we figured we’d pop back to the train station and get a ride from there as it was barely five minutes up the road.

But we decided to give it a shot, showed him the hotel address, squashed ourselves uncomfortably into the seat and set off. At least it was cheap.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52223343337_4bdb62fdc7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224366258_f2b5dfa683_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>It turned out not to be as hair raising as I imagined as the streets he took weren’t super busy. And while there was the obviously risk of simply tipping out of the front of the seat, we did at least get a good look at where we were going.</p>\n    \n    <p>In fact, the streets seemed a deal smarter than most of the ones we had seen. And then they started to look familiar.</p>\n    \n    <p>Because sure enough, this driver had also brought us to the wrong hotel. The same wrong hotel as the day before. Like, HOW???</p>\n    \n    <p>We all confused each other merrily over payment - we decided not to even both explaining that this wasn’t where we wanted to be - and instead went inside the hotel to ask them to ring us a taxi.</p>\n    \n    <p>It was a posh affair, 5 star, and with a wedding in full flow. The guests were dressed to the nines and then some - to the twenty-fives at least when you added in the tall hair feathers - and the buffet had just opened. Inside the lobby, we found reception (next a table manned by three identically dressed wedding guests in flowing gowns who were organising vast numbers of gifts and goody bags) and the staff proved good-natured and friendly. They laughed at our predicament, offered to order us a taxi through the app and asked us about what we were doing in Malang and Indonesia. They also giggled when they found out we’d come in the crazy bike cab, and told us it was called a Becak.</p>\n    \n    <p>Quite why they couldn’t ring us a standard metered taxi wasn’t clear, but they were super helpful and we figured that if we start at the wrong address, the car would at least know not to bring us back here. A small win, but one we were prepared to take.</p>\n    \n    <p>I felt a little out of place in my slight grubby shorts and T-shirts, sweating into the hotel’s nice chairs. After a while, we were sent off on a tour of the hotel with one of the porters, taking in the pool, the outdoor restaurant, the Italian restaurant and the gift shop. We were a bit non-plussed but were prepared to go for it if they could help us get back to the hotel.</p>\n    \n    <p>When our tour finished, the car had arrived and fortunately, this time we were conveyed to our actual hotel. It had taken us over an hour to get back - seriously, how is anyone meant to get around here? It was like a 15 minute drive!!!</p>\n    \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224355846_e33aafce50_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224846615_bd45b9ab49_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section> \n\n    <p>We decided we were in need of a cuppa and decided to treat ourselves to a proper one with real milk at the Starbucks over the road. Feeling much more fortified and with a sandwich and a raisin scone inside Pete and me respectively, we hopped back to the hotel and decided to go for a swim.</p>\n    \n    <p>My prediction that the pool would be chilly was bang on the money and despite the warm, muggy air, we had to swim laps to keep from getting too cold. As we swam, we discussed how this trip has thrown up so many memories from our last trip and we wondered about what that meant: were we living in the past? Were we drawing comparisons?</p>\n    \n    <p>In then end, we thought no, but it was interesting to think about. I think it highlights that we’re in our element on trips like this, but also the fact that we’re away perhaps automatically makes us think of similar previous times. And that, by reflecting on older memories, we’re building bridges to new ones, enriching them all by drawing the threads together.</p>\n    \n    <p>Equally, thinking of trips we want to take in the future doesn’t mean we aren’t enjoying the now, just that the present is beautiful and inspiring and it’s natural to dream.</p>\n    \n    <p>Deep thoughts for quite a shallow pool.</p>\n    \n    <p>Post-swim, we pooped back up to our room, posted on our blog and settled down to watch an episode of Lost. We worked our way through most of the series last time we travelled and the combination of mystery and adventure seems to work well on the road. So we started from the very beginning and as this was my second viewing, I was interested to see if I would pick up on any of the clues or foreshadowings along the way. This would be Pete’s 3rd viewing and he was deep into the internet, looking up the significance of tiny details to share.</p>\n    \n    <p>We set out for an early dinner before six wandering the area around the hotel (we had no desire to get a taxi anywhere) and with slim pickings in the vicinity, we ended up at Burger King. The restaurant was doing a roaring trade in delivery orders, and once we’d managed to communicate our order (harder than you’d think given that the menu is entirely in English) we sat back to wait.</p>\n    \n    <p>We’d both ordered a Black Busan burger - beef for Pete, chicken for me - and as Pete pointed out, we should have been in Busan at this point for real. However, I doubt that we could have had a more authentic experience than the burgers we munched when they arrived. They had black, seeded buns, some sort of unidentified fritter in them, spicy sauce and, inexplicably, a small pot of rice crispies. Because reasons?</p>\n    \n    <p>The food was tasty enough, the jasmine ice tea I ordered was frankly disgusting being so packed with sugar it made my teeth rattle (I didn’t drink it) and while we can’t claim to have eaten traditional Indonesian food, we did at least eat like locals if the sheer number of Burger King orders were anything to go by.</p>\n    \n    <p>Back in our room, I caught up with my journal, had a tea and watched and episode of Modern Family with Pete, and then we settled into bed. By 8:00pm.</p>\n    \n    <p>Why? Because we were getting up at quarter past midnight.</p>\n\n</section>",

A shower was particularly welcome and we stumbled down for breakfast to investigate the buffet. It was a huge spread and we had no idea what most of it was, but we tucked happily into noodles, an eggy thing that was a bit like a teriyaki vegetable omlette slice, chicken and prawn crackers. Plus some small cakes, because apparently that’s a thing?</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, this revived us a little bit and we set off down the street to find the nearest cash point and stock up on food and water for the day. To our surprise, the first ATM we found was both a) where the map said it was and b) in good working order and so we availed ourselves fully of its services and then went across the road to a small shop to spend our spoils. We picked up a rag tag collection of crisps, biscuits and water and Pete picked a small cheese cake - we had no idea if it was cheesey or cakey but he was game - and we scuttled back to the hotel.</p>\n\n    <p>We packed up our bags, sorted our day packs for the trip ahead and leaving our backpacks with reception, we waited for our driver for the day.</p>\n\n    <p>After about 20 minutes he appeared - pretty prompt by local timekeeping lore - and we set off through the jostling, bustling city. It was another scorcher idea the day and the humidity had skyrocketed, but inside the car was cool with a welcome blast of air con. I watched the tangle of the city go by as mopeds with multiple passengers swarmed around us on all sides. It’s an impressively chaotic dance where everyone ought to crash and no one does.</p>\n\n    <p>The city itself is chaotic: very lived in, shops and stalls and carts spill out onto the street, shiny, well-kept buildings are interspersed with half-collapsed structures and run-down shacks and greenery takes every opportunity to sprout and grow in the lush climate.</p>\n\n    <p>After I while, the motion of the car and our recent dearth of sleep made me feel dozy and I half nodded off as we made our way towards Borobudur.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219941464_f0fbf7c2a5_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224806000_2628f717b6_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Borobudur is a 9th Century Buddhist temple which crowns a hill in a pyramid-like formation. It’s covered in reliefs and carvings, huge numbers of statues of Buddha and hundreds of stupa, leading up to the largest ones on top. Borobudur was mostly abandoned by the Javanese following the conversion to Islam in the 14th century but when, in the 19th Century, British chap Raffles on his jolly colonising mission heard tell of the place from locals, he instituted a bit of a clean up and made Borobudur more widely known.</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227396692_b26d244197_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <p>I had visited back in 2015 but it was Pete’s first time on Java so everything was new to him. I could see differences too - you were no longer allowed to climb the huge structure which I suppose is a win for preservation but a lose for being able to see any of the statues or relief detail. Plus I had been looking forward to the views from the top! We spent a while debating this: who and what is preservation for if no one can see any of the thing being preserved? Pete was strongly in favour of restoration so that people can get up close with ancient monuments. I think I’m team partial restoration: restore bits so that you can see how something was supposed to look back in the day, but also leave plenty in its natural state.</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227396202_2848a96904_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <p>I’m not sure there’s a right answer but we were intrigued.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228408268_437cce1791_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228674349_a929d5a467_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section> \n\n    <p>We found a lovely carved Lion statue guarding the bottom of one of the staircases.

And actually, the temple buildings did remind us of the bud-like structures that dominate the Angkor Wat skyline. We made for the largest temple structure first: the 47m high curved, pointed central tower drawing everyone towards it. This was flanked by two slightly smaller ones on either representing Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu. Another three towers stood in front and this formed the main platform, and we spent a good while wandering between them, enjoying the carvings. Highlights being the cheery creatures grinning over the tops of the doors and the dragons which roared from the end of the stairways with little bonus demons popping out of their mouths.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52223318402_7d25dd0c75_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52224810445_4868f502c4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>  \n\n    <p>Surrounding this central platform is the rubble and ruin of what we’re originally 240 smaller temples, but most of these are now simply heaps of stone thanks to earthquake damage and the passage of time.

Re-tracing our steps from the night before and dodging mopeds and scooters and tuk tuks and cars, we rambled round to the entrance and waved our tickets and passports at the security team.</p>\n\n    <p>We wandered on towards the platforms and then shuffled shuffled back again as we had no idea where to go. The security chap proved quite helpful though and advised us to get on at platform three.</p>\n\n    <p>We clambered across several tracks to the waiting area. The station was busy, but with people rather than trains. There was a general air of sleepiness as all present simply wanted to get on their train and close their eyes for the night, and the warm, sticky air made everyone feel drowsy.</p>\n\n    <p>After about 45 minutes, a promising looking train pulled into platform 3. We joined the general throng moving towards it, but the guard waved us away and said this wasn’t our train. Which was weird as it was the right time, the right platform and seemed plausible. We asked one of the smartly turned out train staff just to be sure, but she confirmed that it wasn’t our train so we had nothing to do but dawdle around for a bit.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately another train pulled up about ten minutes later and this time the guard seemed satisfied that we had an acceptable ticket. He waved us down the platform for the right car, and piled on in, stashing our bags and sliding into our seats. Finally!</p>\n\n    <p>The trusty train crew brought around blankets, the air con started to cool us down a little and the train trumpeted on repeat - it seems to be a thing here, as they sound the horn pretty much constantly - as we rolled out of the platform.\n\n</section>",

        "content": "<section>\n        \n    <h1>Day 7</h1>\n    \n    <p><span class=\"dropcap\">H</span> learned roughly nothing from our previous extra long travel journey, we had embarked on a second. Our flight left Male a little late, some time after midnight and landed in Singapore just over 4 hours later. However, with a 3 hour time difference, this made it almost 8:00am so somehow we’d lost the night time.</p>\n\n    <p>Plus we discovered our gate for our flight on to Jakarta was MILES away.</p>\n\n    <p>We set off walking, feeling a bit dopey, alternating between travelling on foot; riding the tramelators and even taking a small train ride at one point. Singapore Changi is an incredibly cool airport, but it’s just that it’s slightly less so when you have to walk across it all in a transfer window.</p>\n\n    <p>Once we’d reached the approximate area of our gate, we decided a cup of tea was in order and we we joined the queue for Starbucks. As did pretty much everyone else in the far reaches of the airport so it was half an hour before we were able to claim our cuppa and found led it was just one guy trying to take orders, make drinks and serve food. Yikes.</p>\n\n    <p>Drinks in hand, we then hustled to the gate, knocking back the scalding liquid as fast as we could before submitting to the rigours of airport security which in Singapore, happens at each individual gate.</p>\n\n    <p>I do not regret the tea though. That was GOOOOOOOOD.</p>\n\n    <p>Despite the fact that the flight was under two hours, they woke us up to feed us some sort of rice and yam and mushroom dish. I could take it or leave it, but the chocolate cookies were tasty! And what with take off, food and landing, that pretty much filled up the whole flight.</p>\n\n    <p>It took us a while to navigate Jakarta airport. We had to visit a set of desks with our vaccine certificates and check in on the Indonesian health app, we had to visit the visa payment counters and then the visa counters, we had to go through passport control and through customs and between every step would be another set of airport security staff looking for a particular stamp or piece of paper. We were only sent trouping back once as the health check people had given Pete the all clear but not stamped his boarding pass, but we finally made it to baggage claim and out into the warm, sticky arrivals halls. We waved off the mob of taxi and hotel hawkers, found a cash machine and made ourselves millionaires (for the tune of about £70) and then we gritted our teeth and approach the over enthusiastic taxi crowd. We were offered a ride for 350000 IDR which is steep according to our research so we declined and decided to take our chances outside at the taxi rank, despite the chap calling after us that he would offer us a discount to 300000.</p>\n\n    <p>This proved to be a good decision - credit to Pete - as the chap manning the taxi ranks offered us 215000 for a ride to the city. Sold!</p>\n\n    <p>Although it must be said, probably what the extra hundred thousand or so buys you is seatbelts and a driver who drives on the road instead of bombing down a hard-shoulder/type gap at the side of the road approximately the width of a cycle lane such that the gap between the concrete barriers and the queue of traffic is slightly narrower than the taxi.</p>\n\n    <p>But we made it unscathed and finished the journey by having a bit of a set-to with our driver who wanted extra money for parking which we refused - we’d included a decent tip with our payment partly because fair play, but partly because we had no change, so we weren’t going to add a couple of extra thousand for parking as well.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52220157625_408f4cf410_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219670911_407febe672_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We stumbled into Gambir train station, slightly disappointed to find it completely lacking in air con and consequently extremely hot and humid inside. A security guard helped us swap the train booking voucher Pete had acquired for actual tickets and then we high-tailed it to the station Starbucks because apparently we’re those people.</p>\n\n    <p>Say what you like about Starbucks: when you’ve got a four hour wait for a seven hour train, it’s nice to know you can wait somewhere with wifi, a cup of tea and a seat you can chuck your luggage on.</p>\n\n    <p>After a couple of hours and a film, I ventured forth to find us some sustenance. Pete had spotted sandwiches and snacky bits in a little convenience shop, plus water that wasn’t at Starbucks prices, so I picked up a giant bottle (necessary) and a sandwich for Pete.</p>\n\n    <p>The whole experience was a bit of a reminder of what life of the road is really like after the not-a-care-in-the-world Maldives. Just little things like navigating squat toilets in leggings without much give, the constant presence of smoke around us in Starbucks, the fact that the second round of teas I ordered was really a cup of hot milk with a teabag floating in it - occupational hazard for a tea drinker in a non-British country where you don’t speak the language and we drank them anyway without comment - and the unforgiving, relentless humidity melting us into puddles.</p>\n\n    <p>Having said that, it was also a proper launch back into travel and life on the road, and I wouldn’t swap it!</p>\n\n    <p>OK, I would swap the tea, but the rest? I’ll take it for the chance to travel.</p>\n\n    <p>We took it in turn to pick up train snax from the various little convenience shops in the vicinity and the hauled our laughed across the station concourse to find out platform. We had to take a covid temperature check (we were melting; how we passed this I have no idea) and show our passports and then we found our train mostly by eye smiling behind our masks and waving our tickets in front of people to point us in the right direction.</p>\n\n    <p>Half an hour before it was due, the train was already waiting in platform, so we shouldered onto our carriage - eksecutif 1 - and found our seats. Fortunately the luggage racks overhead were big enough to accommodate our backpacks, and there was plenty of leg room for our day packs and snack bag. Plus the air con was on and they’d furnished each seat with a blanket which promised the train would be cool later on.</p>\n\n    <p>The train was pretty full and Pete pointed out when he’d booked our tickets a week ago, that there were very few left, and standard and business class had already sold out. There was an even more fancy train class above ours - eksecutif luxury - but for quite a lot of extra money you didn’t seem to get much more benefit. Our seats reclined a decent way, we had foot stools and little fold out tables, and we were pretty happy to live the semi-cama life for the next seven and a half hours.</p>\n\n    <p>I set an alarm on my phone in case we fell asleep before we rolled into Yogyakarta and I also plotted our destination station on my phone so that I could see roughly how far we’d come mid-journey if necessary. Ready for business!</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52218662922_04d71da69b_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <p>The journey passed relatively comfortably. We sampled the tortilla chips we’d bought - spicy for Pete and BBQ beef for me (Pete’s were better) and I nibbled on biscuits which were a bit like lemon flavoured ritz crackers. A bit weird, but they sort of worked.</p>\n\n    <p>I spent the first four hours catnapping, watching Jakarta slip by outside the window, giving way to less and less “organised” streets and buildings into more suburban seeming little communities. Every so often the passage of the train held up the traffic and throng of mopeds would be swarming the barriers, itching to resume their journeys. At one point, several small children were playing on the next track over, one of them dancing and waving ferociously at the passing train.</p>\n\n    <p>In the end I abandoned my audiobook as I kept drifting off for a few minutes and suddenly finding I’d lost the thread. However, just before nine, I found myself awake, a little cold from the air con and a bit restless while still feeling tired. Pete was in full slumber mode with his eye mask on and earplugs in, and so I figured I’d watch a film and keep an eye on the time. So I consumed the rest of my tortilla chips, knocked back a few more lemon Ritz and watched Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. Perfect.</p>\n\n    <p>With the film finished, there was a little over an hour to go on the train and I pushed the alarm I’d set a little later and listened to some more of my audiobook. However, this time I caught myself drifting off and abandoned the pursuit earlier. That makes it sound like a bad book: it’s actually excellent, one of the Slough House books, and it’s because I’m enjoying it so much that I don’t want to miss it. But equally, once again it’s been nearly 36 hours since we had a proper night’s sleep and it’s hard for anything to cut through that level of drowsiness, especially a well-narrated audiobook in a smooth voice that you’re listening to with your eyes closed. It invites too much temptation to sleep.</p>\n\n    <p>At midnight, the train staff confiscated our blankets, presumably in readiness for pulling into the station, so there was nothing for it but to prepare our bags and wait to slide into the platform. Which we did at around half past midnight. Time for a hotel and bed!</p>\n\n    <p>OK, so it took us a little longer to sort that out that we’d hoped for as we could only get out of the station on the wrong side of the tracks. Literally. And this in spite of climbing backwards and forwards through our train and climbing up and down over other train lines. That’s just how the station works.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, Pete figured it out eventually and after a bit of a walk round - and a wait while a fright train went through and they closed the barriers across the road - we made it to our hotel for the night. Which was actually really lovely, with a giant, meandering fish tank behind reception, a big water feature and best of all, a room with air con and a cold shower.</p>\n\n    <p>A quick blast of fresh, clean water from the shower and a round of teeth cleaning and we were ready to sink into bed, leaving tomorrow for tomorrow.\n\n\n\n</section>",

This is more surprising than it may seem as July is very much off season for the Maldives as the weather is prone to rain and thunderstorms. At a resort whose entire premise is built around being outside and open air, storms are of course less than ideal.</p>\n\n    <p>But we’ve had none of it: off season deal, high season weather. Winner!</p>\n\n    <p>We had been told we didn’t need to check out until 6:00pm which was handy as we could therefore still spend the day swimming and so on, before returning to our rooms for a proper shower and pack. We would then get a speedboat back to Male ready for our flight which wasn’t until 11:25pm. That’s right folks: another series of overnight transport complications as we began the proper “travelling” part of our honeymoon.</p>\n\n    <p>But first things first: breakfast. Our all-inclusive access ran out at noon so we hatched a cunning plan to help ourselves to extras from the breakfast buffet to feed us at lunchtime. Goals.</p>\n\n    <p>We rocked up with a secret hidden ziplock bag concealed in a bag for life - double subterfuge - and tucked into the usual array of goods. I had some top banter with the omelette guy who was simultaneously knocking up four different omelettes and running a steady stream of innocuous chit chat. My favourite bit was when he asked if I was enjoying the weather - and I said it was beautiful - he laughed and said it was like my smile.</p>\n\n    <p>I was wearing a mask.</p>\n\n    <p>Ludicrous waffling aside - and actual waffles consumed - we started adding extra pastries, cakes and fruit to our plate.

However, once we’d got that sorted, we were ready to don swimwear and enjoy our last few hours in the sea.</p>\n\n    <p>But not without getting one last mango slushy from the swim up bar before our all inclusive ran out.</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228374193_3eda394044_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n    </div>\n    \n\n    <p>We idled away the day beautifully, swimming in the sea and the pool and relaxing in the sunshine reading or chatting and just trying to soak up all the beauty around us. The Maldives is picture perfect beautiful, and even that seems cliched in a way that doesn’t do it justice. The unbelievable aqua blue of the crystal clear sea, the perfect, powder white sand and the brilliant blue skies alongside a daily routine that asks you simply to be seems too good to be true and yet it’s here, quietly existing, rolling each day into the next.</p>\n\n    <p>Around half two, we were flagging in the heat and decided to head back to the villa, but having trouped all the way there, we found our key cards had stopped working. Sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately, a passing gold cart took mercy on us and gave us a ride to reception where they updated our key cards and we began the trek back to our little home over the sea.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52227360692_b4bd21547d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52228375138_b544b9cdfa_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section> \n\n    <p>We couldn’t resist one final swim though - as Pete pointed out, you so don’t often get to jump into the ocean off your own balcony and so it seemed silly not to take more advantage of this. And the water was so cool, a beckoning shade of crystal turquoise, so we hopped in and splashed about, enjoying our last few Maldives moments.</p>\n\n    <p>We would definitely be sad to leave, but I suppose that only means we made the right decision to come, to recapture some honeymoon magic and to enjoy a slice of paradise that was just for us.</p>\n\n    <p>We spent our last couple of hours in the villa packing and sorting, munching through our breakfast time spoils over a cuppa, and catching another episode of Slow Horses. Then with a final cuppa and a sunset selfie our our villa deck (a bit of a fail as my hair was constantly blowing in Pete’s face and his attempts to hold it out of the way were ludicrous) we checked out.</p>\n\n    <p>We made our way to the lobby, settled the bill and then had an hour or so to kill in the lobby bar, which I passed sorting through the various pictures I’d snapped and getting bits and pieces arranged for our blog. At half seven, we ventured to the jetty to meet the speedboat and were whisked across the dark ocean with the other passengers, the flashing lights of Male and the airport beckoning.</p>\n\n    <p>The airport run was reasonably smooth and we were able to check in without incident and most of the right paperwork. Proof of a flight out of Vietnam nearly stumped me without wifi but the app I’d booked with seemed to have some sort of residual memory and came up trumps.</p>\n\n    <p>Once ensconced in departures, we grabbed a Burger King, splitting some onion rings and tucking into a burger and fries apiece with an abundance of ketchup as Pete got a bit over enthusiastic dispensing his own from the pump.</p>\n\n    <p>As we munched, I commented that I was really glad Pete was up this. Which I then realised sounded like I meant sharing a portion of onion rings. While they were the best thing about the meal - both alone and in my burger - what I meant was that I was glad Pete was up for a honeymoon with a backpacking feel that let us explore and venture out instead of staying in one place. Being on this trip definitely made us reflect more on our round the world adventure and it was so magical to recall favourite moments, draw parallels and be reminded of some of our best times.</p>\n\n    <p>We shimmied down to the gate soon afterwards and waited for our flight to be announced.</p>\n\n    <p>When the time came we boarded, settled down into our seats as much as we could and prepared to sleep for as much of the flight as possible while the kids behind us screamed and kicked the backs of our seats. Honeymoon life, baby!\n\n\n</section>",

A couple of pots of tea and a spread which included omelettes, potato wedges, donuts, chocolate muffins and granola soon perked us up.</p>\n    \n    <p>It was incredibly warm - it seems that mornings here are particularly muggy which makes for calmer waters, but that when the wind stirs up a little bit, ocean swimming is more of a challenge but the breeze is invariably quite pleasant,</p>\n\n    <p>After breakfast, we changed into our swimwear and hit the quiet pool again, because apparently that’s our rhythm now, and we spent a lovely morning swimming in the sea, swimming in the pool and lounging betwixt the two. We watched a couple of fish meander through the water, a heron we keep spotting alighted on the sea wall to intimidate the local crab population and tiny lizards occasionally skittered over the sand. All while the startlingly blue sea did its thing and the sun shone down. Welcome to paradise!</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219581394_fe86572991_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219312836_fd6d1a7558_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We continued our now tried and tested rhythm with a final quick sea swim before a quick shower and change and off to lunch. I munched happily through a plate of Thai green curry - I’m loving my daily lunch curry - while Pete tackled his standard bit of everything with fish and chips on the side. We have no idea what the fish is though. Then we continued playing rate that dessert, determining that the best of the day’s cakes was Pete’s tres leches cake and that the banana chocolate thing was weird. I looked like cheesecake but the creamy bit was weirdly gritty and extremely soft, as I found out when I tried to slide out a little piece with the tongs and only succeeded in splatting it round my plate. The flavour was fine but overall not convinced.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately I was able to console myself with a chocolate brownie, a blueberry parfait and a pot of tea. Sometimes you just have to look for those silver linings.</p>\n\n    <p>We opted for our traditional afternoon snorkel after lunch and so got kitted up, carefully prepping our masks with soap as we learned from our diving qualification, and headed back towards the quiet pool. Pete reckoned if we slipped out over the sea pool wall, we might find some good bits of reef to explore. And so we did, being only slightly startled by a shoal of tiny fish who chose the exact moment we slipped into the water to jump out of it, making a small splash and a slightly larger commotion.</p>\n\n    <p>Also, despite our careful mask prep, they fogged up immediately and so we abandoned protocol and had to settle for flushing them out with seawater. Which worked. Sigh.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete’s instincts were as even unerringly accurate. A few moments swimming off the shore out into the lagoon we did indeed come across a feast for the eyes. The reef suddenly dropped away turning the shallow azure waters that ringed the island into an inky blue depth. Think the drop off, a la Finding Nemo.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, the edge of the drop off was covered in rocks and coral and swarms of fish were busying about, swimming, drifting, nibbling at things and pouting at one another. They all ignored us supremely giving us ample opportunity to drift slowly along edge of the reef, spotting fish both familiar and new and caching brief glimpses of larger specimens sliding in and out of the darker depths beyond the reef. These mostly remained shapeless, being just occasional glimpses silvery scales as they happens to catch a solitary stray sunbeam, but mostly, we couldn’t make out what lurked below.</p>\n\n    <p>In the shallows, there was wonderful visibility, and the colours continue to be dazzling. We saw fish with black and white spots, leopard print, bright yellow and black stripes, iridescent purple greens which shifted colours as the fish scales undulated and one particularly impressive orange and pink striped specimen.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete managed to catch sight of a pale silvery squid writhing near the surface and I saw it for just a few seconds before it whisked away. I was also super chuffed to have found a couple of tiny clown fish peering carefully out between the fronds of a coral. Or possibly not true clownfish, but something very similar.</p>\n\n        \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219309486_6542027238_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219327236_d6238505e4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Once we’d tracked the end of the reef back towards the sea villas, we swam back into the shore, which proved quite a strenuous task against the current and we were a little out of breath when we bobbed through the feeder gap of one of the sea pools. Feeling tired but happy, we flopped onto a couple of loungers in the shade. Our best snorkel yet!</p>\n\n    <p>Somehow the afternoon drifted to early evening so we had a quick shower and change, wandered past the mini sharks enjoying their snax and settled into the Viu bar.</p>\n\n        \n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212740987_82e03bd2d9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52218302137_d3dfdc0ffa_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>The sun was setting, slipping in and out of the clouds which dappled the horizon and we each ordered a MRS to sip on as we gazed out over the sea. It was incredibly warm, there being no breeze that evening to stir the sticky air and the cold drinks were very welcome. The occasional bat circled overhead, the bartender presented us with a second round of drinks and a cheese sandwich each, and Pete was able to accurately identify it, so winning.</p>\n\n    <p>(Side note: I just paused in my journaling for a moment as Pete wondered if I fancied watching another episode of Slow Horses. I asked if he could give me five minutes to finish the journal and he said no. I suggested he make us both a cup of tea and he replied “Noooooo, I’m lying here!” So he’s had a hard day. I then asked him if there was anything he would like to add to the day’s journal and said “Nice snorkelling” which I feel like I’ve already sort of covered so now he’s making tea and I have used most of my bonus time in sharing this anecdote. Mostly because it made me laugh.)</p>\n\n    </section>\n\n        <div>\n            <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219578209_4d17b4abcd_b.jpg\" class=\"full-width\" />\n        </div>\n        \n    <section>\n\n    <p>We had one more round of drinks #makingourmoneyback before heading over for dinner at half seven, these evening’s buffet theme being Smokehouse. So of course I had pasta and Pete did the assorted dead animals full justice. Actually, he let me try both his chicken and fish, both of which had great smokey flavours but the former particular was strong with a crispy, chargrilled outside and a tasty barbecue sauce.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52218301962_58ebcef69d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219793290_aec458a376_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n\n    <p>Puddings were necessary, naturally, and alongside a pot of tea we tackled white forest cake, almond cake, fresh pineapple, vanilla cheesecake and, my favourite, lemon meringue pie. I had two of those. Not sorry. It was definitely the best. Pete also rated it, and agreed the cheesecake was a good attempt but could be creamier and would be nicer with a fruit element, but then I always thing that about vanilla cheesecake. Like, what’s the point?</p>\n\n    <p>After dinner, feeling pretty full, we popped back to the bar for a cold drink as the air was still very hot and clammy despite the appearance of the dark evening. We stuck to soft drinks and lounged on one of the nets stretched out over the sea; I even spotted a shark snaking silently through the waters below. Say what you like about the bar, you can’t argue with the setting.</p>\n\n    <p>Eventually, the lure of the air con proved overwhelming and we returned to our room to cool down, journal (in my case) and then enjoy an episode of Slow Horses with a brew. Classic.</p>\n\n    <h1>Day 5</h1>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219595799_c3ae85316b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219580884_6b29b38895_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We woke slightly startled to our 8:30 alarm both having been in the middle of quite odd dreams. But we managed to surface anyway and clear off the table in our villa as this morning was our room service breakfast!</p>\n\n    <p>An in villa breakfast was one of the perks I managed to score when trawling the internet for hotel deals in the Maldives, and we’d selected a bunch of options each on arrival. We got dressed and ready and sure enough at nine, our breakfast was delivered, brought into our room and balanced on a tray. The chap who brought it offered to lay it out and somehow that single tray kaleidoscoped out into a huge spread including things we didn’t even remember ordering.</p>\n\n    <p>We’d gone for eggs sunny up - two apiece, mostly ordered on my part because it’s fun to say “sunny up” in foreign parts. Fried eggs is just a bit uninspiring in comparison. We’d also got beans, toast, croissants, pain au chocolate, orange juice, muffins - vanilla and chocolate - a fruit platter and yoghurt. Phew!</p>\n\n    <p>Oh, and of course a pot of tea each.</p>\n\n    <p>Winning!</p>\n\n    <p>We put paid to as much as we could, stashed a few leftovers in our fridge, fed some of the watermelon to the fish because it is basically the most disappointing and underwhelming fruit on the planet, and got ready for our bait morning ahead.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219312571_45a0ec8c8b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219326218_1b170870a0_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Time to paddleboard! The resort lets you take our stand up paddleboards whenever you like so we trotted along to the water sports area and grabbed a board each. They were light weight and easy to slide into the waves on the beach but we soon realised that made them extra challenging to balance. I’m no expert, but I’m perfectly comfortable standing while doing SUP. However, on these boards with the waves going up and down, I struggled. We both did! Even kneeling up, which is normally steady as a rock, I struggled a bit and in the end we both found it easiest sat cross legged a paddling out against the waves as the boards rose and fell.</p>\n\n    <p>Having burnt my parting over the past couple of days, I was determined to stay on my board so I could wear my hat against the sun’s scorching rays. It was after all, another scorcher, already over 30 degrees and humid. In fact, it was unbelievably lovely to have the water wash over the board and keep me a little bit cool. So I determined to stay seated if that’s what it took to remain out of the sea, hat intact and I had a lovely time paddling out to sea and then driving my board back into the shore, the waves behind me carrying me faster. It was lush! I even spotted one of the reef sharks swimming past on one of my runs.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52218305847_c0496f7c08_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219581154_f7ddfb829b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Pete however was soon getting down to business. Returning hat and shades to the beach, he was going to SUP if it was the last thing he did, being slightly less willing to embrace the SDP life.</p>\n\n    <p>SDP being sit down paddleboard, obviously. I’m embarrassed for you that you couldn’t figure that out from context.</p>\n\n    <p>And so he ploughed cheerfully out into deeper waters and got to his feet.</p>\n\n    <p>And tipped straight off the side into the water, the fall shooting the board away from him. An energetic swim after it as the waves gently nudged it out of reach eventually put him back in possession of his vessel and he started all over again.</p>\n\n    <p>To his credit, while it took him multiple goes - and some ridiculously comic tumbles into the water - he did eventually achieve some sort of mastery over the SUP, managing several reasonably lengthy paddles between subsequent immersions. I have the pictures to prove it. After a while though, the sheer exertion of balancing an uncooperative board in a mocking ocean seemed to pall, and he abandoned his board in favour of snorkelling.</p>\n\n    <p>I paddled around for a while longer and then decided that before I too abandoned my board, I’d give standing a go. I slung my bad and shades onto our lounger and returned to the sea, determined to win.</p>\n\n    <p>It seems my resilience does not last as long as Pete’s. My first two attempts resorted in sideways collapse and a cartoon-style backpedal over the back of the board. Both ocean plunges also caused me to inhale a large amount of salt water. Yuck.</p>\n\n    <p>The third was a little better and I got a paddle in before I cam crashing down, and my fourth which seemed optimistic also ended in watery failure. In fact, I was neatly deceived as when the board starting tipping to the right I managed to prevent it by leaning left, but of course over compensated and my elation in preventing my fall was quickly snuffed out upon my descent into the sea. And another large shot of sea water to the digestive system. Double yuck.</p>\n\n    <p>I figured four goes was enough, and we decided to leave our boards to the experts and Potter round to the quiet pool for the rest of the morning.</p>\n\n    <p>I had a swim in the pool, and the sea and then the pool, and Pete went for another snorkel around the reef drop off before we both returned to our loungers for a bit of a chill and a read.</p>\n\n    <p>A quick change before lunch and we were ready to take on our final lunch buffet. We had been saying the night before how time has a weird way of passing here. It’s a strange cycle of swim eat swim eat and suddenly it’s the end of the day and nothing has really happened. It’s not a bad thing at all, but I think a few days is probably enough for us, as somehow being in the resort isn’t like being in the real world. Everything is done for you and while there’s a certain simplicity in that, it also sort of removes your choice.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, lunch was yummy, the desserts being particularly strong across the board so that even though my favourite - the lemon meringue of the previous night - didn’t feature on the plate, the average rating of all the desserts was it’s highest. In fact, honourable mentions go to the chocolate Swiss roll, the pineapple upside down cake and a particularly delectable almond cake with nut brittle topping. Tooth-crackingly tasty.</p>\n\n    <p>It was still incredibly hot though - obviously - so we decided to retreat to our room for a little post-lunch air con reprieve. Much appreciated.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219793320_210b1c7c95_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219340693_3067c4e3fc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We opted to hit the sea for another snork about in the afternoon, so we headed back to the quiet pool, ditched our things and splashed off the little sea wall into the lagoon, sending the little crabs who were out snacking on sea gin scuttling for cover. We had soon paddled out to the drop off and we spent a happy hour floating along over the enormous deep blue aquarium of the ocean, admiring the colours and diversity of the fish and bustling serenity of the coral reef as little creatures snuffled about, floated around and wiggled around each other.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete spotted an enormous sea cucumber, I found a sizeable starfish and as we were swimming back to shore, a flurry of small black fish scooted beneath us. Turning, we spotted a good sized shark snaking past on its way. It was both amazing to see one so close and a bit unnerving as even though it couldn’t have been more than 4 feet in length, there is something sinister and predatory about the way sharks swim: with a hunter’s intent and none of the endearing, harmless and gentle bobbing most of the reef fish engage in.</p>\n\n    <p>It ignored us entirely, swimming straight and true through the water and we paddled back it into the sea pool through a gap in the sea wall.</p>\n\n    <p>We swam a couple of lengths of the pool to rid ourselves of a sticky salty overlay - the pool had absorbed the heat of the sun no end and was bath-like on temperature after the pleasant cool of the sea - and the we reclined for a while on our loungers for good measure.</p>\n\n    <p>It wasn’t long before a round of drinks was in order and so we decamped to the pool bar. Or at least I did while Pete returned our snorkelling equipment, there being hefty fines to pay if you leave it in your room. However, as I arrived at the pool, I found it was quite busy: the warm day had brought everyone out, the lure of drinks in the water proving irresistible and while most loungers were unoccupied, they were all claimed. In fact the only available spots I could find were two of the reclining boat seats within the pool, so like a veritable lightning ninja, I made a beeline for them and threw all our possessions into their beckoning - and mercifully dry - cushions.</p>\n\n    <p>Then I swam up to the bar because swimming up to things is life. I grabbed us a MRS each before wading happily back through the pool with my prize and we officially commenced pool lounging - not to be confused with deck lounging, beach lounging or even poolside lounging.</p>\n\n    <p>Know your lounging, people.</p>\n\n    <p>Anyway, we were were on track with our hectic lounging schedule and I was nearing the end of my book and I was definitely at the end of my cocktail. In an unforeseeable plot twist, the rabbi and the porn star had got together and then complications had ensued and they had broken up. With about 15% of the book left to go and no way of predicting how the end would turn out, I reasoned that more drinks were very much going to be in order. I was of course accurate. Pete concurred and I selflessly offered to swim up to the bar and retrieve them.</p>\n\n    <p>I swam my little heart out and perched on a submerged bar stool, chatting to another guest and swapping travel anecdotes while the bartender blended ice and mango and happiness.</p>\n\n    <p>Also rum.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, I was half way down my cocktail before I remembered I had only fulfilled half of my drinks duty. One must always remember that if you want the reward of swimming up to the bar, you must accept the responsibility of swimming back from the bar. So I excused myself from the chit chat and delivered Pete his slightly melted cocktail.</p>\n\n    <p>The sun had started to drop behind the fronds of the beachfront palms and it was a lovely spot to chill and watch the world go by. The beach was being set up for a seafood BBQ with twinkly lights and hanging lanterns, along with an impressive kitchen set up and a stage for the musicians and it was quite impressive the way a restaurant seemed to have sprouted where, a mere couple of hours ago, there had been only sand.</p>\n\n    </section>\n    <div class=\"double\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219339533_a536fed1a3_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219325911_23910bcfd7_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n    <section>\n\n    <p>As evening started to draw near, we headed back to our villa as we were both sporting a little bit of sunburn and the heat coupled with cocktails and glowing skin was making us feel a bit woozy. A shower and a cup of tea perked us up though, and we ventured forth for dinner at half seven.</p>\n\n    <p>We’d booked the Thai restaurant again for the evening - the $105 per person price tag of the seafood BBQ putting us off somewhat - and it was nice to sit out on the beach, enjoying the live music and the soft breeze coming off the sea. From our table, we had a good view of the twinkly lights and lanterns and enjoyed the live music while we ate - we’re imaginative souls and ordered the same food as before. Because hey, if it’s tasty, it’s tasty!</p>\n\n    <p>We followed up our meal with a drink at the bar - just soft drinks though as I think we were both feeling done for the day - and then we wandered back to our villa to chilla.</p>\n\n    <p>Couldn’t resist.</p>\n\n    <p>I worked on my journal for a bit, Pete did incomprehensible things with his laptop, we complete our Maldives departure forms and we would have checked in for our flight the next day except that the Singapore Airlines website was down for maintenance. That could wait then.</p>\n\n    <p>Finally, it was time for a cuppa, a little slice of Slow Horses action and the chance to find out if the rabbi and the porn star would ever find happiness together.</p>\n\n</section>",

So are main goal for the day was to live the resort all-inclusive life and make our money back. Ah, romance!</p>\n    \n    <p>We slept for over 12 hours in the end, which after minimal sleep and a 4:30am get up, followed by pretty much 36 hours on the go, we needed by like a thousand percent.</p>\n    \n    <p>Every then, it was a slightly sleepy stumble to breakfast.</p>\n    \n    <p>Two pots of tea down though, and a tasty breakfast tucked away, we felt more ourselves. To be fair to Pete, he totally smashed it and went full crepe, which he reported to be excellent. I was feeling a little delicate and so decided to play it safe with granola and some banana bread.</p>\n    \n    <p>Although when I found that Pete had located fresh passionfruit, I went back for a couple of halves of that queen of fruits and we split a plate of passionfruit over our second pot of tea.</p>\n    \n    <p>We booked a table for dinner in the resort’s Thai restaurant and then decided to walk back to our villa the long way round and see the whole island.</p>\n    \n    <p>I should just clarify that the long way round takes maybe 10 minutes, and the word island is an optimistic word for small heap of sand which is holding up the resort.</p>\n    \n    <p>We walked across a couple of beaches complete with beach bungalows and beautiful areas for swimming in the sea, we found the quiet pool - no bar and no music, just a serene swim and a decking by the sea - and then we wound up back at the main pool and bars.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52220090440_33439d091e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219587781_d2a2efa8cc_o.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n    \n    <section>\n\n\n    <p>The sun was fierce and by the time we’d clopped along the pier to the decking we were both feeling quite sweaty in the warm, humid air. The sea was calmer though than the previous day and we had scouted out some snorkelling spots, so we decided on a quick shower, a brief chill to allow our suncream to soak in, and then we’d hit the sea and visit the fish.</p>\n    \n    <p>Within five minutes of this plan being planned however, the wind picked up, storm clouds rolled over and the little undulations of the sea around our villa turned into foam-topped ways. In fact, the noise the wind made whipping and whistling through the wooden stilts and planks was quite dramatic!</p>\n    \n    <p>With the red flag flying for dangerous swimming, we decided to postpone snorkelling for the afternoon and instead pottered along to the quiet pool.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52220119020_3767371e81_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52218366965_a825228c84_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We enjoyed a swim, both in the pool and in the sea, the beach being protected by a stone barrier which absorbed the biggest waves. We were amused by the line-up of crabs perched up on the rocks, balanced on their tippy toes and watching our progress through their water in an imperious fashion with unblinking, beady eyes. And somehow the morning drifted by in a heartbeat and it was time for lunch. Sweeeet!</p>\n    \n    <p>Lunch was a banger today, the buffet featuring a chicken bhuna that was top notch with a solid level of spice, and alongside some salad, rice and poppadums made for an excellent meal. The lemon cheesecake on the dessert buffet also happened to be my favourite pudding to date.</p>\n    \n    <p>After lunch, wandering back to our villa, a few drops of rain plopped out of the sky, but the weather struggled to show any real commitment to this, managing at best some slightly sulky cloud cover. Undaunted we decided to give snorkelling a go after all and this time we launched off the beach to explore the reef. There were plenty of fish hanging around to be peered at and pointed to, and drifting around the bay, bobbing in the surf, we saw lots of brightly coloured fishy friends. A brief search on Google enlightened us somewhat as to what we’d spotted and included parrotfish, moorish idols, powder blue surgeonfish, convict surgeonfish and picasso triggerfish.</p>\n    \n    <p>I obviously knew all these names instantly upon spotting the fish and googling was just for Pete’s benefit. Cool cool cool no doubt no doubt.</p>\n    \n    <p>Pete also managed to spot a black tipped reef shark and swam after it but it was too quick. I was facing the wrong way and so missed it - standard.</p>\n    \n    <p>Anyway, the marine life was abundant and we saw lots of other fish that my internet research as yet to identify. I like the little black and white one that buzz in little groups around the coral, and we saw a huge yellow chap bumping around along the bottom sticking his pouty snout into this and that, raising little sand clouds.</p>\n    \n    <p>After about an hour, I climbed out and left Pete to it, opting for a little swim in the completely empty main pool. I felt like I was in one of those hotel adverts, stepping lightly down the pool steps and arcing into a graceful breaststroke at exactly the right moment.</p>\n    \n    <p>It’s possible it didn’t look like that but who will ever know?</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219595004_c91fdb057f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219875894_e0ee4d3d1f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>When Pete pried himself from the sea, we visited the swim up pool bar for a bit of a day drink. I opted for the mango slushy of the previous evening and then asked on a whim if the bartender could chuck in a shot of rum. He happily obliged, Pete ordered the same and while in this bar, they were more drinkie than slushy, we enjoyed our drinks very much, watching some of the guests play beach volleyball and the palms wave in the breeze.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52218586617_bc9539b297_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52220078170_f27c0cebc4_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>After a brief micro swim and a chill on the in-pool loungers, we decided to relocate to our beach loungers, because we are nothing if not constantly busy and on the go. Seriously, we’ve hardly stopped! Pete reckoned we should get another drink first however - wise chap, first rule of all inclusive: make your money back - and so we headed back to the bar. Pete walked because having used the swim-up feature he is now too cool for it, but I swam because I will never get tired of swimming up to a bar. Like literally never. If I could also swim up for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I totally would.</p>\n    \n    <p>Note to self: open a swim-up tea room. It would be lush, with floating tea trays and inflatable biscuit platters. Also, bobbing cake stands.</p>\n    \n    <p>I digress.</p>\n    \n    <p>So I swam up, ordered our drinks, stoutly refused Pete’s offer to carry my drink to the beach - if I’m going to swim up to the bar, I’m damn well also going to swim away clutching my drink like a tiny liquid prize - and we settled into beach loungers.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52220077625_71e2e7449f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219326756_1f15c15b37_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>By the way, Pete had opted for a beer, but I went for a lime and gin-based concoction called a Gimlet, purely to increase our experience of the full cocktail menu and help us know what to order. It was reasonable and better than some of the previous day’s drinks, but not as good as the rum mango slushy combo with the name that is impossible to recall when your a few drinks down.</p>\n    \n    <p>In fact, I’m now going to think of it as the MRS - Mango Rum Slushy, and perfectly named for a honeymoon, no? As long as we don’t mind a bit of patriarchy with our liquor.</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212732717_5734003d0d_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52214221775_8cf255510b_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Eventually we wandered back to our room, pausing to watch the sharks feed again which is undeniably entertaining. Pete pressed on, keen for his shower, but I perched on the side of the pier, dangling my feet over the edge and watched the little black tip reef sharks swimming around with gusto. Once the feeding was over, they dispersed remarkably quickly. When of the other guests asked if they somehow knew it was the end of the feed, and the staff member simply smiled and said “oh, they know”.</p>\n    \n\n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219327001_21754ed52a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52213756708_176d6454fc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>A shower and a cuppa revived our energy and we sat out on our decking, listening to the ocean wash up and down, reading, journaling and gazing out at the incredible aqua blue. The sun slipped slowly down over the horizon, concealed behind clouds, and a sea breeze made it beautifully pleasant.</p>\n    \n    <p>And BOOM! Time for dinner!</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52214224195_df41cd7e4f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52213744321_95dfc31292_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>We had booked for the resort’s Thai restaurant and so meandered down the decking towards the island. A golf buggy passed us and the stopped to give us a lift - hilarious - and so we caught a ride to the pool and thence to the snax.</p>\n    \n    <p>I say snacks: it was a tad more elevated than that. We were offered an outdoor table and jumped at the chance, seating ourselves beneath a gently waving palm, listening to the waves lap against the beach a short distance away and bathed in the soft glow of a couple of up lighters. Dark had come on rapidly, and the nearby pool was lit with little green sparkles making me think of bioluminescence or possibly a disco ball. Try as we might, we couldn’t spot the source of the dancing green lights so we abandoned the attempt, enjoying the live band and perusing the menu.</p>\n    \n    <p>I opted for chicken satay (winner!) followed by Thai red chicken curry, and Pete went for spring rolls followed by Thai red beef curry. It’s like we’re meant to be together. We convinced the waitress that we did indeed want it to be spicy, and while she questioned whether we’d had spicy food before, she was eventually won over by our enthusiasm. Hot stuff.</p>\n    \n    <p>The food was fab! I washed mine down with a glass or two of Cava while Pete sank a couple of beers and I dabbled delightedly in satay sauce, rich with peanutty happiness, and a curry which did indeed have a potent kick.</p>\n    \n    <p>We both polished off our portions though, and while I cannot claim to have eaten delicately in the dark, I did at least consume my plateful with gusto. Our waitress seemed satisfied with our efforts, checking one last time that we like spicy food, and we rounded off the meal with a scoop of sorbet apiece, mango for me and strawberry for Pete.</p>\n    \n    <p>We popped around to the overwater bar after dinner and enjoyed another drink each, a beer for Pete and a MRS for me. We lounged on the sofas hanging over the sea and gazed at the moon and the island, debating whether the moon itself offered enough light to see by if the electrics all went out. I thought no, Pete was more positive.</p>\n    \n    <p>We also learned that the Maldives is the world’s most dispersed country. Fun fact!</p>\n    \n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52214224380_4e31ba26ce_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52213759013_55b507b13e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n        </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Around nine or so, Pete suggested returning to our room and sitting out on our verandah, sinking our bottle of arrival fizz. I figured we may as well give it a go and so we tottered happily back out along the pier over the sea and reclined accordingly. Lush!</p>\n    \n    <p>Pete popped the cork on our Cava and we worked our way steadily through it, toasting the moon and dreaming up retirement plans because apparently post honeymoon, that’s our next goal. Dream big people, dream big.</p>\n    \n    <p>Actually, it was completely lovely with the dark sky meeting the darker dear, the moon glowing here and there through the patchy clouds which revealed the odd star and cava fizzing pleasantly in the flutes. We listened to the quiet shushing of the waves against the villa and the cool breeze off the sea stirred the warm air perfectly. I started a book - something suitably trashy which was honeymoon-resort appropriate, and if I tell you that three chapters in, an incredibly attractive former porn star has met an incredibly attractive rabbi and they’ve agreed team up to work on a lecture series about modern relationships, you’ll know exactly the sort of book I mean. It’s excellent and I of course have absolutely no idea what the possibly outcome might be.</p>\n    \n    <p>I started telling Pete about it, but when the phrase “a rabbi meets a porn star” doesn’t grab you, possibly he’s just not going to be into it. Weird.</p>\n    \n    <p>Approaching midnight, we shuffled back inside our villa, enjoying the cool air con and watching a couple of episodes of slow horses. Or at least, finally finishing the first one and watching the second. It’s great, nuff said. And then we turned in, a beautifully long night of luxurious sleep beckoning.</p>\n    \n    </section>",

Goodness only know what version of the honeymoon plan we’re on now. All I know is that we’re a long way from where we started, but that finally, it’s actually started!</p>\n\n<p>A 4:00am wake up, followed after some tossing and turning by my 4:30am alarm, an early morning covid test - NEGATIVE BABY! - and an early morning cuppa apiece and we shouldered our backpacks, luggage tags bobbing merrily behind us, and set out into the mellow dawn for the tube.</p>\n\n<p>Our route to the airport had been the subject of some back and forth, as the first district line train for us wasn’t due until 5:24am which meant our airport ETA was 6:40am.</p>\n\n<p>Which means that because I am neurotic, I was nervous about cutting into our 3 hour airport arrival window for our 9:30 flight.</p>\n\n<p>However, with an Uber and Elizabeth line option as a back (an expensive one, but there) we decided to chance the normal tubes and it mostly worked. Even though it was relatively busy, we got a seat and trundled our way across London arriving at Heathrow only fifteen minutes later than we should have done, which isn’t bad by public transport standards these days.</p>\n\n<p>And then we saw the queue to check in and I immediately wished I’d been less tight-fisted regarding the Uber.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, we joined the queue to join the queue, shuffled along and eventually reached the point where could join the official queue. Cue various officials shuffling people around between different barriers in a way that makes you inwardly screech at them to stop faffing about and check people in instead of telling us when to step forward.</p>\n\n<p>Outwardly, I smiled politely.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that apparently there’s a bonus check in procedure which you could do to upload various documents online and skip to a shorter “verify to fly” queue. But we’d been completely unaware of this option and by the time we uploaded our documents on the hoof in the queue, it made not one blind bit of difference. So we queue shuffled, made friends with an Australian lady who tried hard to convince the queue guards to let us join the quicker queue, and stewed silently watching the shorted queue be efficiently managed by 4 open desks while the immense main queue was served by 2 counters. Logical.</p>\n\n<p>Have I mentioned, it’s annoying to queue early morning? I wanted my airport honeymoon cup of tea!!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, after an hour and 20 minutes, we were able to drop our bags, and with another 20 minutes to duffle through security, we were airside, to find our flight was about to start boarding. But Pete is a maverick and reckoned we should break the rules and push boundaries and so we went to get a cup of tea anyway, me manfully holding our position in the queue in Costa while Pete ventured out in the field for a speedier option.</p>\n\n<p>He found Pret virtually empty so we grabbed a cuppa each and hauled off to our gate where our bags were sniffed by a very good boi with a waggy tail and fluffy spaniel ears. Which we did not touch because it’s not allowed but it was tempting nonetheless. We inhaled our tea, somehow did not get upgraded to first class - weird - and took our seats on the flight.</p>\n\n<p>All passes pretty smoothly. We both watched the Friends reunion, I was provided with two cups of tea, and I had a snooze and watched half of Moana. Also strong recommend the chocolate mousse which came with the meal, and the pizza lattice hot afternoon snack which had a promising Gregg’s vibe about it.</p>\n\n<p>We landed in Abu Dhabi around 7:00pm local time and settled into some comfy chairs in one of the gates to while away our 6 hour transfer window. I went to find us some tea but it wasn’t until after I’d bought it that I realised it cost £9 for two cups, which practically finished off our honeymoon budget. Still, it hit the spot and with a packet of Maltesers buttons I found with my bag, we happily whiled away a couple of hours.</p>\n\n<p>When people ask how to keep up with a travel journal while away, this is the secret: spend your six hour layover jotting down unnecessary detail.</p>\n\n<p>Also, send repeated emails to your hotel asking them when and where to meet the transfer you’ve booked.</p>\n\n<p>With a couple of hours to go, we had a brief debate over whether our next flight would feed us. Given that it departed at one in the morning and landed around 6:00am local time, we figured probs not, and so set off about the airport in search of some sustenance. Burger King came up with the goods, and after a burger for Pete and some chips for me, we satisfied our hunger and then wandered off to find our gate.</p>\n\n<p>Boarding the plane behind a group of drunk, off-key Spaniards who entertained the whole gate with tortured renderings of a range of songs which I suspect will never recover from this enthusiastic treatment, we settled in ready to get the rest of the way to our destination.</p>\n\n<h1>Day 2</h1>\n\n<p>The overnight flight from Abu Dhabi to the Maldives passed smoothly; at just over four hours, it wasn’t hugely long and we both slept through as much of it as we could. Pete in particular cut a do-not-disturb figure with his face mask, eye mask and neck pillow obscuring almost all of his head.</p>\n\n<p>We landed in Male feeling pretty drowsy. It was coming up to seven in the morning as we checked through passport control, but our body clocks said three in the morning, meaning we’d been on the go for nearly 24 hours and now it was time to start an entirely new day.</p>\n\n<p>However, we had a cunning plan of staying awake until the evening in order to smack our body clocks to order and the passport stamp we got at immigration had a small turtle on it so things were looking good.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these thoughts don’t seem particularly connected but I’m functioning without sleep so roll with it.</p>\n\n<p>The one final thing that needed to happen before I felt I could slide into pure trip fun mode was getting from the airport to our hotel. I’d booked a speedboat transfer to the tiny island when I’d reserved our hotel - less than 48 hours ago, yikes! - but had no information about the transfers, where we needed to go to meet the speedboat and what time the boat left. Having sent 3 emails, a Facebook message and an Insta DM to the hotel and received no reply, I had definitely moved into viewing this as another problem that needed to be overcome before relaxing could commence.</p>\n\n<p>Emerging into airport arrivals with our bags revealed lots of envoys carrying signs for this or that resort, but nothing for us. The only thing for it was to add credit to make international calls on my phone and try giving the hotel a ring. I spotted a large number of desks dotted around the arrivals hub, again each for a different resort, and so I decided to do one last-ditch circle around these just to make sure there was no one to ask.</p>\n\n<p>And the very last desk proved to be the one. Not only that, the woman at the desk was indeed expecting us and showed us where to wait until the speedboat transfer came to collect us. Perfect!</p>\n\n<p>It turned out the boat was bobbing up and down on a mooring right outside the airport - kind of insane - and before long, we were kitted out with lifejackets, handed bottles of water and being zipped across the sea.</p>\n\n<p>The journey took about 15 minutes or so, and we flew over the waves, spray erupting around us as we passed big container ships and left the bustling industrial vibe of Male behind.</p>\n\n<p>We were helped off the boat and taken to reception, our bags spirited away to be delivered to our room. It was still well before 9:00am at this point, but a welcome drink of cranberry and lemongrass plus a lovely cold, wet towel to wipe our faces refreshed us and helped wake us up a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Given that check in wasn’t until three, we were of course a tad on the early side, but we managed to sort the paperwork and payment necessary and score an upgrade to a sunset villa - winning! We aren’t sure what the difference is between a sunset villa and a normal villa but they are more expensive so we decided we were cool with that.</p>\n\n<p>The resort reckoned our room would be ready before too long and to pass the time we were shown to the chill room where tinkly spa music played and we could help ourselves to a cuppa. We started watching the Slow Horses series which I’d been super keen to see since reading a few of the books, and by ten, we were collected and told our villa was ready!</p>\n\n</section>\n\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52213727346_97562eaf26_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52213727236_3a22cd9c35_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n<p>When I say collected, I’m being serious: waiting for us was a little golf cart and our driver took us on a small (tiny) adventure round the island to see the different bits of the resort: the restaurants, the dive centre, the spa, pools and bars before finally driving us out along the wooden pier where the villas were located. Apparently you can drive on it. Who knew?</p>\n\n<p>There were 80 in all, blooming either side of a long, snaking boardwalk that stretched out over the sea.</p>\n\n<p>The sea which was, by the way, that absolutely unreal shade of cartoon turquoise blue that you see in pictures but not in real life.</p>\n\n<p>Our room was lovely - the bed laid with flowers around heart-shaped sheets, a great shower, massive picture window overlooking the ocean and our own private little deck projecting out over the sea and complete with loungers. Lush!</p>\n\n<p>We’d also been given a fruit platter and bottle of fizz - winner - and it was lovely to have a sense of arrival, our trip and indeed our honeymoon properly beginning!</p>\n\n<p>We both felt pretty tired and ropey, but we were determined not to go to sleep until the evening to make sure our body clocks were slammed into the right time. Even though we’d now been on the go for over 24 hours. But sleep and jetlag are for losers and weaklings so with that in mind, we hopped into our swimwear and set off to test our the pool.</p>\n\n<p>The pool was lovely if a little chilly, and right by the sea which we also tested out. The sea proving a bit warmer in the final reckoning. There was a little beach swing, recliners in various shapes and sizes including some boat-shaped ones that were actually in the pool, and a swim up bar. I had honeymoon swim up bar ambitions to fulfil, but as our all-inclusive package didn’t kick in until noon, these would have to wait.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we realised we were both starving not having eaten since Burger King over twelve hours ago. Time for lunch.</p>\n\n<p>We popped back to our villa to shower and change and then set off for our first food experience at the main restaurant which served a buffet daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We were hungry and very much ready to do it justice!</p>\n\n<p>It turned out to be a vast and delicious array and we each opted for a variety of different bits and bobs. Highlights included sweet corn fritters with sweet chilli sauce, a rather tasty daal with poppadums and a great papaya salad. Plus the fact that there was a dessert buffet didn’t hurt, the walnut and honey cake being a surprising favourite.</p>\n\n<p>We wandered back to our villa and I sat on the bed before immediately flopping over with exhaustion. We proved that if we weren’t going to fall asleep, we needed to keep moving. Time to snorkel!</p>\n\n<p>We visited the dive centre to pick up snorkel gear and peruse the trips on offer. We immediately deemed them all too expensive and quite happily settled for snorkelling for free around the house reef - Pete has eagle eyes in the ocean and had already spotted various fish and a couple of reef sharks.</p>\n\n<p>Carting our gear back to our room, we suited up for snorkelling, pulling on a T-shirt each over our swimwear. We’ve been burnt before snorkelling and find this does wonders for protecting your back from the sun. Then we clambered down the staircase straight off the end of our villa’s decking and plopped into the sea. Blissful! We had hung various bits and pieces out off our decking so we’d know which villa to climb back into but it turned out to be unnecessary as some enterprising soul and anticipated this challenge and numbered them all on the seaward side. And so we pressed our masks eagerly into the water and set our flippers a-paddling.</p>\n\n<p>The water was surprisingly choppy with a decent bit of swell, but we figured 80 villas gave us 80 potential emergency escapes if necessary, so we swam along the reef on the outer edge of the peer. And there was a surprising amount to see! Lots of fish bobbed and twirled about over the coral and the rocks, in all different shapes and sizes and colours. We swam and floated down most of the length of the pier - a bit inconsiderable distance - and enjoyed marvelling at this hidden underwater world. It’s always curious to me how clearly you can see the teeming life through a snorkelling mask in the water, but you can’t really see much of anything when you peer at the sea from above. Even the brightly coloured fish are well camouflaged.</p>\n\n<p>Swimming back to our villa was a challenge as we had to swim against the current. Thankfully the flippers gave us a little more swim power but it was still with a slightly grateful and relived slump that I finally hauled myself out of the sea and onto our decking.</p>\n\n<p>We had yet another round of showers - necessary and also lovely - and then decided to explore one of the bars.</p>\n\n</section>\n\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52213742238_85d6fabcd9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52214001124_8600a62bbb_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n<p>I was keen to try the Viu bar, perched as it was over the sea with sofas to recline on all around the edge and even those nets you can lounge on suspended over the water. Excellent! Additionally, it turns out the circular structure is open in the centre and you can sit in the middle and look down into the swirling sea.</p>\n\n<p>The bar happened to be serving afternoon tea and canapés - a few sandwiches, some choux buns and some cookies. I felt like a sweet treat so opted for the latter two and the cookies in particular were yummy! Although tiny and barely even bite sized so I had to have four.</p>\n\n<p>As I was still feeling incredibly sleepy - if not dopey - I decided to order a mocktail when the bartender came round. I went for a Fini Anbu which is a name I immediately forget every time I try and remember it and I have to look it up on the menu.</p>\n\n<p>So what’s a Fini Anbu? I’m glad you asked: it’s an insanely lovely mango slushy with lime and grenadine. And it’s lush! It was like slurping you tasty sorbet in the heat of the day and once I’d realised that the red swirls around the glass were part of the pattern and not the grenadine waiting to be devoured, I finished it off pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p>And ordered another.</p>\n\n<p>Pete manfully started tackling the list of cocktails in the name of research, sinking a Singapore Sling and a Daiquiri. Neither of which were as good as my mango slushy.</p>\n\n<p>The drinks and the bar and the sea and the sun whiled away time quite happily, but I started to feel like I was going to fall asleep where I was sitting. It was opportune therefore that it shark o’clock.</p>\n\n<p>Well, mini shark o’clock anyway.</p>\n\n<p>At five each day, the resort feeds the fish, chucking chunks of something that is clearly dead over the side of the walkway and into the sea. The fish pounce upon it eagerly with a thrash of tails and fins and the most eager of the predators is the black tip reef shark.</p>\n\n<p>The ones in the shallows are only little and while we’d seen the odd one swimming when peering into the sea, it was nothing like the swarm that congregated for feeding. As they’re juveniles, they’re about half the size of fully grown sharks who reach about 7m in length and can weigh up to 30lbs. Hefty,</p>\n\n<p>Even though these mini sharks were young though, they still had an unmistakably shark-link prowl, their signature fin breaking the surface, their movements sleek, sinuous and predatory. Apparently they live in the shallows when they’re young, teaching themselves to hunt as their mothers have zero maternal instinct. They’re apparently inquisitive and curious but mostly harmless and it was quite something to stand above the water as they zeroed in on anything that landed in the sea.</p>\n\n</section>\n\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52213742328_a7ff5a668f_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212718467_ea7a559da8_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n<p>Once the sharks were satisfied, we popped back to our villa to get changed for dinner but as that wasn’t until seven, we moseyed on back to the bar. I was absolutely shattered by this point and with over an hour to go until we could grab our evening meal, we hoped another round of drinks would keep us awake. A mai tai for Pete and a piña colada for me. Then the bartender appeared with a plate of food, offering us a canapé each and explaining they were cheese sandwiches. Fair play.</p>\n\n<p>Pete took two bites out of his before commenting that it didn’t have a lot of flavour and tasted funny. I thought mine was fine and a quick comparison revealed that Pete was under the impression he was eating pineapple.</p>\n\n<p>Pineapple!</p>\n\n<p>I laughed like a drain before realising Pete had mis-heard the word canapé, not heard “cheese sandwich” at all what with masks in the way, and that he had quite confidently worked on the assumption that the finger sandwich he was attacking was somehow constructed from dried pineapple and possibly some sort of bready cake. Unreal.</p>\n\n<p>That right there shows exactly how drowsy we were. If you can’t tell the different between a cheese sandwich and a chunk of pineapple on sight, never mind two munches in, you need to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>But we managed just about to hang in there until seven, dawdling over to the restaurant and grabbing a bit of buffet. I struggled to raise any kind of appetite at all but was delighted to be offered tea in a vague bid to get through the evening. Pete managed an impressive buffet spread with a beer and entertained me thoroughly by eating the dessert selection he had picked. In case you’re wondering, while he thought the chocolate tart was objectively the best, he’s not fond of very rich chocolate things and preferred the lighted cheesecake-esque thing. Although felt it could have had more flavour.</p>\n\n<p>So now you know.</p>\n\n<p>I asked Pete to rate other aspects of the buffet but he refused point blank, explaining that he only does desserts.</p>\n\n<p>He also pointed out that I looked so tired as to appear drunk which was accurate - that was practically how I did feel - but unfair given that I’d had one cocktail all day and he had worked his way through half the menu. Still, given that it was me slumped back in my seat concentrating on keeping my eyes open, I had to hand him that one.</p>\n\n<p>And so it was that we staggered back to our room, arms around each other for balance, heading finally for some sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Except that Pete thought it would be nice to watch the rest of the slow horses episode. I was game and we gave it but after about 5 minutes, I realised Pete was a sleep and while I could follow the plot having read the book, I doubted Pete’s chances. It took me three goes to wake him but I managed eventually and we put the laptop aside and hit the lights. Half past eight. Party on, honeymooners!</p>\n\n</section>",

No we aren't.</p>\n\n    <p>#plottwist</p>\n\n    <p>Because genius here is nothing if not consistent and despite wearing my mask for the last week and shunning all company and activities over the weekend, I have still managed to get COVID for the holidays. Again.</p>\n\n    <p>My main symptoms are rage and a crushing sense of disappointment.</p>\n\n    <p>Add in a hefty chunk of inescapable guilt that I'm dragging Pete through this as well, and you've got a pretty honeymoon-trashing combo.</p>\n\n    <p>But, you can either float around and wallow in that mess of feelings, or you can proactively pull yourself out of the swamp and do something about it. I choose the latter. So aided and abetted by my incredibly supportive and thankfully healthy husband, we have scrambled around to cancel things, claim refunds, consult our insurance, develop alternative options and book some new plans.</p>\n\n    <p>To be fair, I have also done a small amount of sheer frustration crying, but Pete has not only put up with this, but has made me feel infinitely better which is no easy feat when you’re spending almost all your time in different rooms and are concealed behind masks and distanced when we have to occupy the same space. Namely, the space around the kettle.</p>\n\n    <p>So, long story long (you know the drill around here), here's what's gone down over then last couple of days...</p>\n\n    <p>I had a bit of a cold over the weekend. Nothing major: a cold is a cold and they are not uncommon at the end of a school term. A quick check for COVID on Sunday night revealed I was negative so off I popped for the final few days of school as per usual.</p>\n\n    <p>Tuesday morning rolled around and I was up early in the sunshine. I had my pre-departure PCR test booked - a requirement for entry into South Korea - and I figured I’d take a quick test before leaving the house just to make sure all was well and good.</p>\n\n    <p>Except all was very much not well and good and the naive hope and optimism I put into my second test confirmed the worst: I had COVID. Pete was still asleep, being blessed with a job which doesn’t require 6:00am starts, and so couldn’t really think of much to do. My brain was on a bit of a go-slow due to disbelief: I’d check and I was definitely negative - how could I now have covid? The day before our honeymoon?</p>\n\n    <p>SERIOUSLY HOW???</p>\n\n    <p>I figured Pete may as well get the bad news on a full night’s sleep instead of in an early morning flurry from yours truly so I did the only things I could do: made tea, planned and set my cover work for school, emailed all the rearrangements I needed to make for the end of term - an inconvenient time to be off school - and started a deep dive read into our insurance terms and conditions.</p>\n\n    <p>Pete did appear just before nine, stumbling into the kitchen and surprised to find me slumped on the sofa in a heap, dressed for school and worked on the laptop, but not there.</p>\n\n    <p>The bad news propelled him back out of the room until we both had masks in place and I filled him in with as much info as I could.</p>\n\n    <p>My thoughts had pretty much circled around South Korea and I couldn’t think of a way it would be possible for us to go now. In order to enter the country, you need a negative PCR within 48 hours of departure, another negative PCR at the airport upon landing in Seoul, a visa stating your dates of travel and proposed address in South Korea, contact details in case of positive testing and a full health check along with vaccination information and proof of negative tests in the online healthcare system. I had no idea how long it would take me to test negative, never mind how long it would take to be confident I could get clear PCRs. I also had no idea how long a replacement visa would take, or whether Pete would catch COVID from me.</p>\n\n    <p>Whatever way I looked at it, South Korea was off the table.</p>\n\n    <p>I figured we had 3 options</p>\n\n        <p>1) Pick up our honeymoon from the start of the Vietnam section in three weeks time, as they didn’t require any proof of negative tests.</p>\n\n        <p>2) Head to Vietnam early.</p>\n\n        <p>3) Visit somewhere else with low covid requirements and then pick up with Vietnam as planned in three weeks.</p>\n    </ol>\n<p>Option 1 seemed like a waste of valuable honeymoon time. Option 2 had some merit, but we’d already planned and booked our route through Vietnam. We didn’t really want an extra two weeks there as a block - while an extra couple of days in each location would have been wonderful, a two week block just wasn’t that helpful to us.</p>\n\n<p>So we quickly landed on option 3.</p>\n\n<p>But first things first: Pete tested for covid (negative, thank goodness) and as he had a haircut booked, we agreed to regroup in separate rooms having spent the intervening time thinking up possible alternatives. And calling our insurers to find out how much we could claim back.</p>\n\n<p>So Pete left to ponder locations, I jumped in and out of doing my school emails and vaguely browsing the internet for ideas and eventually, having finished scouring our policy, I called the insurers.</p>\n\n<p>To my immense astonishment, the insurers were genuinely helpful. I know it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a service we’d paid for actually worked, but I just struggle to raise any optimism when it comes to insurance as when it comes down to it, you seem to covered for everything except the things that actually happen. However, the lady I spoke to on the phone listened carefully, was helpful and advised me on making a claim and I felt pretty confident we would indeed be able to claim back the costs that couldn’t be refunded</p>\n\n<p>Although ask me about that again when the claim response comes back.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the rest of Tuesday morning and afternoon were taken up with cancelling South Korea bookings, collating paperwork for our insurance claim and, most importantly, country research. Our criteria were specific if not completely straightforward; the destination in question needed to satisfy the following:</p>\n\n\n    <p>1) Have no COVID testing requirements on entry or in advance.</p>\n\n    <p>2) Not require a visa or be able to supply a visa on arrival.</p>\n\n    <p>3) Be geographically located so that we could get to Vietnam relatively easily.</p>\n\n    <p>4) Be not too expensive to get to.</p>\n\n<p>Also, ideally it would be somewhere we were excited to visit that we hadn’t explored before. But this was a much harder criteria to satisfy given that it had only been 2 years since we backpacked through south-east Asia and visited most of Vietnam’s neighbouring countries.</p>\n\n<p>And therefore, on various grounds, we eliminated Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, China, Taiwan, Jordan, Madagascar, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and India.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we eliminated a lot of places so it’s almost easier to say that we narrowed our choices down to three places: Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>Sri Lanka was easily the most promising. While I had been, Pete hadn’t so it would at least be new to him, I had loved Sri Lanka and there was a great blend of culture, wildlife, scenery and food to be explored and enjoyed. The flights there were also inexpensive, and we also flirted with the ideas of having a couple of weeks in Sri Lanka and then a couple of days in the Maldives nearby. Couldn’t hurt...</p>\n\n<p>Further research however revealed that rioting had recently been a bit of an issue as had fuel shortages. We ummed and ahhed over this for a bit, trying to find accurate information, which is hard when you have locals and tour companies screaming “please come, we need the business” but news reports saying it’s inadvisable. Each time we decided we could make it work, we then learned something that changed our minds, but the final clincher was finding a news report that estimated Sri Lanka had basically enough fuel left for a single day and that it was being rationed for emergency services.</p>\n\n<p>Definitely a no: even if we could get there, we’d struggle to get around, and it felt morally wrong to try and get ferried around as tourists when people’s daily lives were becoming harder by the minute.</p>\n\n<p>Sri Lanka was out.</p>\n\n<p>We considered the Philippines briefly but the flights there were hugely expensive. We had in fact planned to go there on our round the world backpacking trip before COVID made that impossible, but when we looked at the route we’d planned and the things to do, they were mostly sea and beach based which was a) quite similar to Mauritius and b) not much of a replacement for South Korea.</p>\n\n<p>Indonesia then. Pete had never been to Java and I was happy to return so he set to work to see if he could plan a week’s travel there. I meanwhile started investigating Sumatra - a little more off the beaten track, decidedly non touristy and a place we had both enjoyed visiting before.</p>\n\n</section>\n\n<div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52191729204_50581dc673_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52190460992_dbbff24ffc_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n<p>By the time the evening arrived, we were sorted: we had a workable itinerary, a back up plan, and if we weren’t necessarily ready to feel excited yet, at least we knew we had a trip that made good use of our time.</p>\n\n<p>Around nine, I started looking into flights and costed up a range of different itineraries. Eventually I found the most effective combination and while none of the flights were direct, most were overnight and one required a 12-hour layover, they would at least get us where we needed to be within a reasonable budget and time frame, and we wouldn’t have to transfer anywhere that caused us covid issues.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, we discovered that it was cheaper after all to go via the Maldives so we thought screw it, let’s start off with a couple of days chilling on a paradise-style island and try and reclaim some honeymoon magic out of the slightly depressing wreckage of our carefully researched plans.</p>\n\n<p>So Wednesday morning dawned, still all Covidy, I got up once again at early doors to email school and set my cover. It was a little sad to be missing the last day of the school year (and to be honest, setting cover work feels extra futile when you know the students are definitely not going to do it). I also managed to video in for a handover meeting so it was good to get that sorted, and then we were back to planning in earnest.</p>\n\n<p>With our itinerary figured out and flights booked, our next jobs were to book places to stay and work out what we wanted to do. Pete took on Java and I tackled Summatra and by lunchtime we were looking in pretty good shape. Still, it was a bit of a downer to watch the clock tick past the times we were supposed to leave the house, our flight check in time, and the take off that should have heralded the start of our adventure.</p>\n\n<p>All told, Wednesday was another day spent glued to the internet, researching, booking, figuring out public transport networks and connecting up the flights. I also dived head first into Maldives research figuring if we were going to do the thing, we may as well do it properly. I was feeling a bit reckless and as Indonesia is very inexpensive to travel in, I was very willing to divert funds towards a fancy overwater villa and an all inclusive ticket to paradise. But also, I was very willing to find a bargain, and with the whole of the World Wide Web at my disposal, I figured I must be able to hunt down a last minute deal, especially for off season.</p>\n\n<p>With as many bonus (ie free) inclusions as possible...</p>\n\n<p>That pretty much set most things in order: we’d made bookings, cancelled our previous arrangements, stuck the new bits of plans to the old bits and tweaked our packing list as Id been busy WhatsApping trekking guides in the Sumatran jungle and figured we’d probably want to take our head torches after all.</p>\n\n<p>Heading to bed in seperate rooms, poor Pete on the sofa on Wednesday night, we knew we had the makings of a trip again. We still needed to sort things like downloading our NHS vaccine passes, logging our details in apps for transiting Malaysia, travelling in Indonesia, entering and leaving the Maldives and literally anything else we could think of. We also needed a ready supply of cash in various currencies for visas and payments in places where card payments aren’t reliable (the place we were staying in Summatra in particular informed us that there’s one nearby cash machine but that it doesn’t work and when it does you can only get very small amounts of cash). I needed to book our choice of resort for the Maldives and also begin collating and uploading the paperwork for our insurance claim. It kind of surprised me how long these things all took.</p>\n\n<p>The final plan was to make Thursday the hype day: to try and get excited and a little more invested in our new plans, acknowledge that it was inevitable to be disappointed about South Korea - that was where Pete has most wanted to visit - and not pretend to each other that we feeling the way we imagined right now. And of course to also remember that we are incredibly fortunate to be able to work out our plans, travel and explore the world at all.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, we knew we would definitely enjoy our honeymoon once it started and we could leave the stress and frustrations of the past couple of days behind. Because we had several glorious weeks of quality time together stretching out ahead of us, doing our favourite thing, living our best lives and experiencing it all as a team.</p>\n\n\n</section>",

Which stands to reason really, as travel is about exploring, seeing and experiencing new things in new parts of the world and new cultures, it's about learning about people and places we had no idea even existed and it's about embracing all those things together.</p>\n\n    <p>But I'm also excited because with COVID, we haven't been able to do this for a while. And last time we did set out with our backpacks in tow, our adventures were brought to an abrupt end a couple of a months early as the pandemic took hold. It feels like we can now reclaim some of that lost time.</p>\n\n    <p>And finally, I'm excited because this is our honeymoon. Which means I'll be on the road with my husband (like, woah) and that we've upped the budget a tiny bit here and there because it's a special occasion. But mostly that means we get 7 glorious weeks careering about the world together, enjoying lots of quality time and sharing in memories that will last forever.</p>\n\n    <p>So here we go! Enter, the honeymoon blog.</p>\n\n    <p>Following the enormous success of our previous Round the World adventure blog (a big hello to all six of you who read it!) we've decided once again to document our time away. Mostly for us to look back on and enjoy, but we do get a little warm, fuzzy glow when we hear you're reading.</p>\n\n    <p>Also, it's something to do when waiting for trains/buses/planes etc and forces me to actually edit and organise my photos before they get overwhelming.</p>\n\n    <p>So what are the plans for this trip? Well, that's a long story, as this trip has changed a lot from conception to final plan. Long story short, you're reading the wrong blog if you're after something concise and snappy. This is a long story long kind of a blog so if you're hoping for a 'Top 10 honeymoon tips' Listicle you're going to be disappointed*. If you're hoping for tedious detail and tangential utterings then read on my friends! Welcome to the ride!</p>\n\n    <p>Back to the plans: our honeymoon was always going to be a really important part of our wedding celebrations because, as I may have mentioned, we love top travel. In fact, my two priorities for wedding planning were 1) have a fab photographer to capture it all and 2) have an absolutely BANGING honeymoon.</p>\n\n    <p>We started thinking about possible honeymoon plans really early on, although as we were living in a lockdown world, it all seemed to exist in a murky and uncertain future. Despite this, there were still a few dream destinations which sprang to mind: Hawaii and Japan. Japan because, obviously, Japan - we've wanted to go basically forever and our honeymoon seemed like a great time to make that a reality - and Hawaii because we watched lots of Lost last time we were travelling and the scenery just looks incredible. We wanted to go and hike and explore and adventure and see the amazing landscapes for ourselves.</p>\n\n    <p>Finally, we toyed with the idea of adding a third destination to our trip: somewhere we could go that would be inexpensive and allow us to dip our toes into the more traditional honeymoon waters but without paying insane Maldives-type prices. But somewhere that would also give us lots of interesting things to do instead of just staying in a resort.</p>\n\n    <p>This aim was partially met, but rather than opting for somewhere sort of resorty, we decided to add Vietnam onto our trip. Inexpensive to travel in, Vietnam is a country we've been super keen to explore and indeed we had planned lots of things to do there while we were backpacking on our year out. But when we actually got on a bus to cross the border from Cambodia to Vietnam, we found that the borders had closed to Europeans as the pandemic was closing in and so we were turfed off the bus unceremoniously and had to make alternative plans.</p>\n\n    <p>Less than a week later, we were back in the UK, slightly stunned along with the rest of the world as daily life dissipated like so much mist.</p>\n\n    <p>And thus, Vietnam was added to our honeymoon list.</p>\n\n    <p>We researched our destinations, looking up exciting things to do, we added key experiences to a wedding gift list which was shared with our guests, and we started to get excited as 2022 approached: wedding year.</p>\n\n    <p>Honeymoon year.</p>\n\n    <p>Well, I got excited. Pete was infinitely more pragmatic and sensible and we made a list of about 7 different backup options to work around different pandemic situations and outcomes.</p>\n\n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52187539147_af9f9e4390_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52191472751_2eaf8d905e_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>And so this blog is going to be the story of our adventures in South Korea, Vietnam, Dubai and Mauritius.</p>\n\n    <p>I know, right? Spot the difference.</p>\n\n    <p>Because if we've learned anything in the last two years, it's that you can make all the plans you like but you've really got no control over which ones actually come to fruition. And that Japan won't let you inside their borders just because you really want to go on your honeymoon, no matter how many times to refresh the Japan travel requirements website.</p>\n\n    <p>In a nutshell, this is what happened. (Actually, a pretty big nutshell with lots of nuts and lengthy explanations). Even at time of writing, Japan is still not generally open to tourists. Once we hit the two-months-to-go mark for our honeymoon, we had to make the decision to change our plans and go with an alternative destination. We also couldn't move our honeymoon dates: I'm a teacher with a fixed holiday period, and either we travel in the summer or we don't travel.</p>\n\n    <p>Naturally, we picked travel.</p>\n\n    <p>So we kissed goodbye to our Japan goals, and made the decision to go to South Korea instead. Also high on our list of places to visit and a culture and landscape we thought we would enjoy exploring. Plus, food. I rest my case.</p>\n\n    <p>At the end of April, we started looking into booking our flights, investigating different routes between Hawaii, South Korea and Vietnam, looking at the price for various options and figuring out where we wanted to be based.</p>\n\n    <p>We've always done our own research and booked all our own stuff before, but we also figured it might be worth looking into booking with a travel agent. While I am quite happy doing travel research - and even quite enjoy it! - we did wonder if booking some sort of custom package would give us good COVID cancellation protection and maybe even score us some cheeky upgrades or give us access to deals.</p>\n\n    <p>Well, the answer the that is: no it doesn't. We quickly found that we could easily beat the quotes offered by travel companies on our flights and we were pretty astounded to be told the best price possible on somewhere to stay in Vietnam was £80 a night. A 2-second search on booking.com found us places that were just as nice - if not better! - for £20 a night. So we pretty quickly abandoned that idea concluding that we are very much not the target market and we are not prepared to pay way over the odds just to have someone else book for us.</p>\n\n    <p>Decision made, we started assembling our itinerary and costing out the trip. And soon we ran into another problem: Hawaii was unimaginably expensive.</p>\n\n    <p>We knew Hawaii was going to be the pricey bit. But when you're looking at over £100 a night for a youth hostel with a shared bathroom - not exactly full honeymoon vibes to shower next to hungover 19-year-olds - it's not the most joyous of prospects. Despite our best efforts, we couldn't find budget options in Hawaii to suit us, never mind when we took into account car rental (apparently they aren't so much into the public transport) and travel between islands. It's not that we were expecting a spendy resort to be cheaper, it's that our usual go-tos of private rooms in hostels, or out-of-the-way airbnbs were still eyewatering on price and were not going to give us an experience that reflected the money we would have to invest.</p>\n\n    <p>In the end, we decided that we couldn't afford to sink over two thirds of our honeymoon budget into a quarter of our trip and so we were obliged to back slightly sheepishly away from Hawaii too.</p>\n\n    <p>So of our original dream trip, we were basically just left with: Vietnam.</p>\n\n    <p>We threw everything out of the window and set about re-thinking our route, destinations and planning. We kept the Vietnamese portion of our trip, decided we were happy with our South Korea substitute, and spent some time googling locations which were similar to Hawaii but, y'know, cheaper. Our requirements were ideally somewhere volcanic with cool hiking, somewhere with a reef for snorkelling and diving and somewhere that would be big enough to have cool things to do. Somewhere where it's just a fancy resort is not really our vibe.</p>\n\n    <p>In fact, simply googling \"where is similar to Hawaii\" produced some useful results and with a quick overview of each, we reckoned on Mauritius for our Hawaii substitute. There seemed to be quite a few things to do, car hire was very inexpensive, and overall, it worked out at about a quarter of the price, even with a pretty nice hotel.</p>\n\n    <p>So that was that, destinations decided!</p>\n\n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"double shrink\">\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52139393985_5bdacfd9f9_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52188518418_ae8bcda04a_b.jpg\" class=\"half-width\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <section>\n\n    <p>Well, almost. We found that getting from Vietnam to Mauritius involved a change of plane in Dubai. We basically had no choice but to spend a couple of nights there and see what all the fuss is about, as Dubai sort of fascinates me in a weird way. It appears to be such a curious blend - or clash? - of cultures and environments, almost like a science fiction sort of place with bizarre engineered land, crazy skyscrapers and rolling desert.</p>\n\n    <p>With about six weeks to go, we booked things in bits and pieces: places to stay, a couple of things to do and the planes, trains and automobiles that would get us around. We scored ourselves some serious bargains, poured over maps to work distances between stations and the places we wanted to visit, scoured the internet for exciting local food to try and also booked ourselves a little treat or two here and there.</p>\n\n    <p>And somehow it's now less than a week to go. COVID tests are booked in, insurance details logged, passports poised, international driving licences ready to flash, old-skool style, and I've stitched us luggage tags with our initials which I think are really awesome and which Pete is possibly just about tolerating. This weekend will be a cheerful flurry of packing, hunting for plug adapters and choosing things to read and watch on the plane and then it will be time to go.</p>\n\n    <p>Good bye work. Hello seven glorious weeks of summer travel.</p>\n\n    <p>I'm so here for this!</p>\n\n    <p>*If we do actually become hot shot, savvy influencer types, I am of course happy to produce this kind of post for the right amount of cash and a free stay in a luxury yet eco resort. By all means, get in touch and show us the colour of your money.</p>\n</section>",
